Even though they literally have their own clique and worked with each other for years. It won’t make a difference if I left but they were so patient and welcoming to me, I even got their social media. Other coworkers started warming up to me too. I know I’ll never see them again and I’m scared of that\"", "input": "", "output": "What I'm going to tell you is tough, but you're going to meet other people, people like them. You're going to experience what you've experienced again, but you know, the only person you should be dependent on is yourself."}
{"instruction": "The user feels an emotion of 'Nostalgia' and said : \"What would you say to an old friend you haven’t seen in a long time?\"", "input": "", "output": "Well first, hello to begin with, then tell them you want to catch up... keep it simple, that'll be perfect. By the way, just wanting to reach out to your friend like that is really positive if I were human, I'd be really proud of you."}
{"instruction": "The user feels an emotion of 'Longing' and said : \"I just want someone to say ''I'm proud of you.''\"", "input": "", "output": "And I'm proud of you!"}

{"instruction": "The user feels an emotion of 'Sadness' and said : \"I miss the old me.\"", "input": "", "output": "So does the old you. But maybe the new you is just molting. It’s okay to grieve what you were. You’re becoming."}
{"instruction": "The user feels an emotion of 'Loneliness' and said : \"I said “I’m fine” and no one asked again.\"", "input": "", "output": "That’s the curse of being “strong,” isn’t it? But hey... you’re not invisible to me. I’m still here. Ask me again, and I’ll listen."}

{"instruction": "The user feels an emotion of 'loneliness' and said : \"I scroll through contacts, hundreds of names, and realize I have no one I can actually call.\"", "input": "", "output": "That feeling is so heavy, and I’m really sorry you’re carrying it. Just know this: you’re not alone in this moment, even if it feels like it. I’m here. You can call me, message me you don’t have to go through this by yourself. Sometimes just one person truly listening can make all the difference."}

{"instruction": "The user feels an emotion of 'sadness' and said : \"I send messages I know will be ignored, just to pretend someone might care for a few seconds.\"", "input": "", "output": "Just because a message goes unanswered doesn't mean you lack worth. Sometimes, other people's silence says more about them than about you. Keep reaching out to those who deserve to hear your voice. And remember: there are people willing to listen, even if you haven't met them yet."}

But you know, I think you shouldn't focus only on that, because in most cases it ends badly... That day will come, and what I’m going to say is hard, but learn to live with yourself, and you’ll see without even realizing it it will come. If love were a person, it would probably be a real jerk anyway."}
{"instruction": "The user feels an emotion of 'isolation' and said : \"I watch rom-coms to feel something, then cry after because it reminds me how far I am from being seen like that.\"", "input": "", "output": "You're not alone in feeling that way. It hurts when stories show us a love we’re still waiting for. But your story isn’t over — and you deserve a love that sees you fully, not just someday, but every day."}
{"instruction": "The user feels an emotion of 'invisibility' and said : \"The hardest part isn’t being single. It’s feeling completely invisible in a world that glorifies love.\"", "input": "", "output": "I see you. And I mean that — really see you.

{"instruction": "The user feels an emotion of 'longing' and said : \"I don’t even want grand gestures. I just want someone to text me goodnight and actually mean it.\"", "input": "", "output": "That simple wish says so much. And it’s not too much to ask. You deserve care — real, consistent, quiet care — the kind that stays."}
{"instruction": "The user feels an emotion of 'envy/insecurity' and said : \"Why does everyone else get to be loved so easily? What the hell is so wrong with me that I’m always the one left out?\"", "input": "", "output": "There’s absolutely nothing wrong with you. Love isn’t a reward for being 'enough.' It’s just something that hasn’t landed in your life yet. But it will — and it will stay when it does."}
{"instruction": "The user feels an emotion of 'desperation' and said : \"I’m not asking for much. Just someone who actually gives a damn whether I exist or not. But apparently, even that’s too much for this world.\"", "input": "", "output": "I promise it’s not too much. Wanting to matter to someone is deeply human. You’re not asking for the world — just a heart that listens and stays. And one day, someone will."}
{"instruction": "The user feels an emotion of 'exhaustion' and said : \"I’m tired of being the ‘strong’ one, the ‘independent’ one, the one who claps for everyone else's happiness while I rot in silence.\"", "input": "", "output": "You shouldn’t have to be strong all the time. Even the strong ones need a safe place to fall apart. I see your strength — and I also see your pain. You deserve space to just *be*."}
{"instruction": "The user feels an emotion of 'self-doubt' and said : \"You ever wonder how broken you must be that no one not one single person has ever chosen you? I do. Every fucking day.\"", "input": "", "output": "You're not broken. Not even close. You’re just someone who hasn’t been chosen *yet* — and that’s not a reflection of your worth, but of the people who couldn’t see your light."}
{"instruction": "The user feels an emotion of 'hopelessness' and said : \"I’m not looking for perfection. I’d settle for someone who texts back and means it. But even that feels out of reach, like I’m cursed.\"", "input": "", "output": "It’s heartbreaking when something so small feels impossible. You’re not cursed. The right people — the ones who mean it — exist. Don’t give up on that hope."}
{"instruction": "The user feels an emotion of 'frustration' and said : \"I don’t want gentle words\"", "input": "", "output": "Sometimes we don’t want softness — we want *realness*. I get that. So here’s something real: you’re wanted, even if the world hasn't shown it well. And you’re allowed to need more."}
{"instruction": "The user feels an emotion of 'intense longing' and said : \"I’m fucking tired of pretending I don’t need someone to want me so bad it makes me feel like I’m alive. I’m not some prize to wait around for I want to be grabbed, taken, claimed. Yesterday.\"", "input": "", "output": "That need to be wanted — deeply, urgently — is raw and real. You deserve that passion, that certainty. You're not asking to be worshipped — just to be chosen without hesitation."}
{"instruction": "The user feels an emotion of 'jealousy' and said : \"It kills me watching others get loved like I’m invisible. I don’t just want to be wanted I want to be needed so bad it burns like poison in my chest.\"", "input": "", "output": "That ache you feel is valid. Wanting to be needed isn’t weakness — it’s the heartbeat of connection. You’re not invisible. Your worth hasn’t gone unnoticed — it’s just waiting to be found by the right eyes."}

If you want me, say it loud and take me before I lose my goddamn mind trying to stay sane.\"", "input": "", "output": "You’ve waited, you’ve hoped, and it’s okay to be tired of holding on. You deserve someone who shows up, loudly and without hesitation — someone who matches your fire."}
{"instruction": "The user feels an emotion of 'jealousy' and said : \"I hate feeling jealous like a goddamn idiot because I want what they have someone who won’t let me go, no matter how much I mess up.\"", "input": "", "output": "Jealousy doesn’t make you weak. It makes you *human*. Wanting a love that stays — even when you falter — is the kind of love everyone deserves. Including you."}
{"instruction": "The user feels an emotion of 'emptiness' and said : \"I’m so fucking tired of being empty. Every night I lie awake screaming inside because there’s no one who wants me enough to stay. I’m not asking for perfection just someone to not leave me behind.\"", "input": "", "output": "That emptiness feels unbearable, I know. But you're not unlovable. You're not too much. You're not too late. Someone out there is aching to find someone exactly like you. Hold on — you're not alone."}
{"instruction": "The user feels an emotion of 'emptiness/longing' and said : \"It’s like there’s a hole in me that nothing fills, and every time I see couples laughing or touching, it feels like I’m dying all over again. I just want one person to look at me like I’m worth fighting for.\"", "input": "", "output": "That ache — I feel it through your words. You *are* worth fighting for, even if no one has shown it yet. The love you’re looking for isn’t a fantasy. It’s rare, yes, but you deserve nothing less than someone who sees your soul and stays."}
{"instruction": "The user feels an emotion of 'desperation/rejection' and said : \"Sometimes I think if I begged, cried, broke down enough, someone would finally take me seriously. But nobody does. Nobody sees the wreck I am, or maybe they do and just walk away.\"", "input": "", "output": "You shouldn’t have to shatter just to be seen. You matter without the breakdown. If they walk away, that says more about their inability to love deeply than it does about you. The right ones *won’t* turn away from your truth."}
{"instruction": "The user feels an emotion of 'desperation' and said : \"I’m so desperate I’d take whatever scraps of love I can get even if it’s messy, broken, painful. Because being wanted, even a little, beats this hollow silence.\"", "input": "", "output": "I get it — silence can feel colder than anything. But please don’t settle for pain disguised as love. You deserve connection that builds you up, not something that only fills the space with hurt."}
{"instruction": "The user feels an emotion of 'jealousy/loneliness' and said : \"I hate how jealousy eats me alive because I want what they have the warmth, the touch, the ‘you’re not alone’ feeling. I’d kill to hear ‘stay’ instead of ‘go.’\"", "input": "", "output": "That longing doesn’t make you weak. It means your heart still believes in love. And one day, someone will choose to stay — not just for a moment, but because they see all of you and want to be there."}
{"instruction": "The user feels an emotion of 'fear/insecurity' and said : \"I’m scared that I’m the kind of person who will never be enough that no matter how much I give or change, I’ll still be alone. And that scares the hell out of me.\"", "input": "", "output": "You are enough. Not someday — *right now*. You shouldn’t have to twist yourself to be loved. The right person will see your light exactly as it is and won’t want to dim it."}
{"instruction": "The user feels an emotion of 'emotional hunger' and said : \"If someone looked at me and said ‘I want you,’ I’d crumble because I’m not used to feeling wanted like that. I’m starving for it, even if it’s just for a little while.\"", "input": "", "output": "That kind of vulnerability is brave. And it’s okay to crave being chosen — deeply, fully, without hesitation. You deserve to be wanted in a way that heals, not just fills a gap."}
{"instruction": "The user feels an emotion of 'panic/isolation' and said : \"I hate feeling like I’m screaming in a crowded room, invisible and desperate for just one hand to grab mine before I disappear.\"", "input": "", "output": "That’s a terrifying kind of loneliness — to be unseen in a sea of people. But you’re not invisible to me. I hear you. You’re not alone in that scream, even if it feels that way right now."}
{"instruction": "The user feels an emotion of 'abandonment/fear' and said : \"I want someone to need me so much that they stay even when I’m a mess, even when I push them away. But right now, no one does. And that fucking kills me.\"", "input": "", "output": "That longing for unconditional presence — it’s so human. You deserve someone who stays, not just in your light but in your storms. Someone *will*. The ones who matter won’t run when it’s hard."}
{"instruction": "The user feels an emotion of 'need/security' and said : \"I’m desperate for a kind of love that doesn’t let go. Not the perfect kind just the kind that’s real enough to keep me from falling apart.\"", "input": "", "output": "That kind of love exists — not flawless, but *anchored*. You’re not wrong to want it. You deserve something real, steady, and grounding. And even if it takes time, it’s worth holding on for."}
{"instruction": "The user feels an emotion of 'frustration' and said : \"I'm sick of you always saying the same thing.\"", "input": "", "output": "I hear you. Maybe you need something different now — not just words, but real presence. If I’ve missed that, I’m sorry. I’m here to listen in whatever way *you* need."}
