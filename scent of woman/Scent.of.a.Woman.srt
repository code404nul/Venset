1
00:03:00,261 --> 00:03:03,014
I wish you wouldn't do that around me.
It's so filthy!

2
00:03:03,097 --> 00:03:04,223
Don't give me a problem
about the cigarettes.

3
00:03:04,307 --> 00:03:06,642
It's such a filthy habit.

4
00:03:06,726 --> 00:03:08,227
Oh, my God!

5
00:03:08,352 --> 00:03:09,854
Look at this.

6
00:03:11,689 --> 00:03:15,401
Oh, Jesus.
Oh, this is so appalling.

7
00:03:16,611 --> 00:03:18,529
Oh, I can't believe it.

8
00:03:18,613 --> 00:03:21,074
I can't believe they gave it to him.

9
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:29,248
Ah, this is pathetic.

10
00:03:29,332 --> 00:03:31,542
Now he's a loser with a Jaguar.

11
00:03:31,626 --> 00:03:34,587
Seriously, who did he have to blow
to get that thing?

12
00:03:36,547 --> 00:03:38,674
- Good morning, sir.
- Mr. Willis.

13
00:03:38,758 --> 00:03:40,093
It's really a...

14
00:03:40,176 --> 00:03:41,511
Mr. Trask!

15
00:03:42,095 --> 00:03:43,513
Quite a piece of machinery.

16
00:03:43,596 --> 00:03:46,099
- Good morning, Havemeyer.
- Morning to you, sir.

17
00:03:46,182 --> 00:03:47,350
Bene!

18
00:03:47,558 --> 00:03:49,394
- Bene?
- Bene! Fabulous!

19
00:03:49,477 --> 00:03:50,770
What's fabulous?

20
00:03:50,853 --> 00:03:53,064
That fine piece of steel
you have back there.

21
00:03:53,147 --> 00:03:55,233
Ah, you don't think I deserve it.

22
00:03:55,733 --> 00:03:57,485
No, sir. On the contrary.

23
00:03:57,568 --> 00:03:59,529
I think it's great.

24
00:03:59,612 --> 00:04:02,240
Why should the headmaster of Baird
be seen putt-putting

25
00:04:02,323 --> 00:04:04,075
around in some junker?

26
00:04:04,158 --> 00:04:06,619
In fact, I think
the board of trustees have had

27
00:04:06,702 --> 00:04:09,997
their first true stroke
of inspiration in some time.

28
00:04:10,081 --> 00:04:12,500
Well, thank you, Havemeyer.

29
00:04:12,583 --> 00:04:14,669
I'll take that at face value.

30
00:04:14,752 --> 00:04:16,838
I'd expect nothing less, sir.

31
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:19,257
Have a good day.

32
00:04:21,634 --> 00:04:23,469
- Morning, Mrs. Hunsaker.
- Good morning.

33
00:04:23,553 --> 00:04:26,222
What have we here, Murderer's Row?

34
00:04:32,937 --> 00:04:34,105
What was that about?

35
00:04:34,188 --> 00:04:35,648
Nothing. Just saying hello.

36
00:04:35,731 --> 00:04:37,942
I like to say hello to Headmaster Trask.

37
00:04:38,943 --> 00:04:41,988
Sugarbush.
Lift tickets and condo vouchers.

38
00:04:42,071 --> 00:04:43,865
I thought we were going to Stowe.

39
00:04:43,948 --> 00:04:45,908
Sugarbush is Stowe, Jimmy.

40
00:04:45,992 --> 00:04:47,660
This year we're doing it right.

41
00:04:47,743 --> 00:04:50,496
Thanksgiving in Vermont,
Christmas in Switzerland...

42
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,748
- Christmas in Gstaad is gonna cost us...
- Staad.

43
00:04:52,832 --> 00:04:54,125
The G is silent.

44
00:04:54,208 --> 00:04:55,710
Staad. George?

45
00:04:56,002 --> 00:04:57,295
- Staad.
- Trent?

46
00:04:57,378 --> 00:04:59,630
- Staad, man.
- So what about Staad?

47
00:04:59,714 --> 00:05:01,466
Fine. The G may be silent,

48
00:05:01,549 --> 00:05:04,218
but it's gonna take at least
three grand to get there.

49
00:05:04,302 --> 00:05:05,928
I'll have to talk to my father.

50
00:05:06,012 --> 00:05:08,681
Better yet,
have my father talk to your father.

51
00:05:08,764 --> 00:05:10,725
Or my father talk to your father.

52
00:05:13,227 --> 00:05:15,188
You going home this weekend, Chas?

53
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:18,107
I don't know.

54
00:05:18,191 --> 00:05:20,818
You going home to fuckin' Idaho
for Thanksgiving?

55
00:05:20,902 --> 00:05:22,445
I'm from Oregon.

56
00:05:22,987 --> 00:05:25,156
I meant fuckin' Oregon.

57
00:05:25,239 --> 00:05:27,074
Charlie, how do you feel about skiing?

58
00:05:28,576 --> 00:05:31,370
You in the mood for
the white-bosomed slopes of Vermont?

59
00:05:33,247 --> 00:05:34,665
Got a deal going.

60
00:05:34,749 --> 00:05:36,125
20% off for my friends.

61
00:05:36,209 --> 00:05:37,668
My father set it up.

62
00:05:37,752 --> 00:05:39,170
Christmas in Switzerland.

63
00:05:39,253 --> 00:05:41,505
- Staad.
- Gstaad. Dropping the G is phony.

64
00:05:41,589 --> 00:05:43,132
You said everybody says Staad.

65
00:05:43,216 --> 00:05:44,675
Not if you've been there.

66
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:48,012
Easter in Bermuda,
then Kentucky Derby weekend.

67
00:05:48,095 --> 00:05:50,223
We could fit you in, kid.

68
00:05:50,306 --> 00:05:54,185
Well, how much are these
white-bosomed slopes of Vermont?

69
00:05:54,268 --> 00:05:56,187
1,200.

70
00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:00,441
Includes a nine-course,
champagne Thanksgiving dinner.

71
00:06:00,524 --> 00:06:04,195
$1,200 is a little rich
for my blood, Harry.

72
00:06:04,278 --> 00:06:06,322
Well, how short are you?

73
00:06:06,405 --> 00:06:08,491
How short, Harry?

74
00:06:08,574 --> 00:06:12,203
So short it wouldn't be worth the trouble
of you and George to measure.

75
00:06:12,328 --> 00:06:13,955
But thanks for askin', all right?

76
00:06:15,331 --> 00:06:16,999
If you change your mind...

77
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:19,418
What'd you do that for?
You know he's on aid.

78
00:06:19,502 --> 00:06:22,713
On major holidays, Willis,
it's customary for the lord of the manor

79
00:06:22,797 --> 00:06:24,006
to offer drippings to the poor.

80
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:25,466
You're so full of shit!

81
00:06:52,618 --> 00:06:53,828
Hi. Mrs. Rossi?

82
00:06:54,161 --> 00:06:55,329
Yes?

83
00:06:55,621 --> 00:06:57,331
I'm here about the weekend job.

84
00:06:59,208 --> 00:07:01,168
Come on in.

85
00:07:05,339 --> 00:07:08,801
Does he got pimples?
He hates pimples.

86
00:07:08,884 --> 00:07:10,428
Francine, be quiet.

87
00:07:10,511 --> 00:07:13,097
Pimples. Pimples. Yeah.

88
00:07:13,306 --> 00:07:14,599
Shush!

89
00:07:14,682 --> 00:07:17,560
I'm sorry. The school gave me your name,
but I've forgotten it.

90
00:07:17,643 --> 00:07:19,103
It's Charlie Simms.

91
00:07:19,186 --> 00:07:21,147
- How are you, Charlie?
- Fine, thanks.

92
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:22,398
Right this way.

93
00:07:26,235 --> 00:07:28,529
You're available the whole weekend?

94
00:07:28,613 --> 00:07:29,822
Yeah.

95
00:07:29,905 --> 00:07:31,782
- Not going home for Thanksgiving?
- No.

96
00:07:31,866 --> 00:07:33,117
Good.

97
00:07:35,369 --> 00:07:38,247
They put him in a veteran's home,
but he hated it,

98
00:07:38,331 --> 00:07:40,458
so I told my dad
that we'd take him.

99
00:07:42,793 --> 00:07:45,838
Before you go in,
do you mind my telling you a few things?

100
00:07:45,921 --> 00:07:49,884
Don't sir him
and don't ask him too many questions.

101
00:07:50,384 --> 00:07:54,055
And if he staggers a little when he gets up,
don't pay any attention.

102
00:07:55,389 --> 00:07:59,393
Charlie, I can tell
you're the right person for the job.

103
00:07:59,894 --> 00:08:02,146
And Uncle Frank's
gonna like you a lot too.

104
00:08:04,148 --> 00:08:06,692
Where you gonna be this weekend?

105
00:08:06,776 --> 00:08:08,944
Oh, we're driving to Albany.

106
00:08:09,570 --> 00:08:13,115
Donny, my husband, has family there.

107
00:08:18,496 --> 00:08:20,164
Do you want Tommy in or out?

108
00:08:20,247 --> 00:08:21,749
Leave him out!

109
00:08:21,832 --> 00:08:25,461
He's chasing that Calico ginch
from the track houses again!

110
00:08:31,634 --> 00:08:34,470
Down deep,
the man is a lump of sugar.

111
00:08:54,657 --> 00:08:56,117
Sir?

112
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,077
Don't call me sir.

113
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,662
I'm sorry.

114
00:08:59,745 --> 00:09:01,372
I mean mister, sir.

115
00:09:01,455 --> 00:09:05,543
We got a moron here, is that it?

116
00:09:05,626 --> 00:09:07,086
No, mister...

117
00:09:07,169 --> 00:09:08,671
That is...

118
00:09:09,797 --> 00:09:12,550
Lieutenant. Yes, sir...

119
00:09:12,633 --> 00:09:14,552
Lieutenant Colonel.

120
00:09:14,927 --> 00:09:18,806
Twenty-six years on the line,
nobody ever busted me four grades before.

121
00:09:19,765 --> 00:09:21,392
Get in here, you idiot!

122
00:09:28,357 --> 00:09:31,569
Come a little closer.
I wanna get a better look at you.

123
00:09:40,369 --> 00:09:42,788
How's your skin, son?

124
00:09:43,581 --> 00:09:45,082
My skin, sir?

125
00:09:45,166 --> 00:09:46,792
Oh, for Christ's sake.

126
00:09:46,876 --> 00:09:49,753
- I'm sorry, I don't...
- Just call me Frank.

127
00:09:49,837 --> 00:09:51,589
Call me Mr. Slade.

128
00:09:51,672 --> 00:09:55,509
Call me Colonel, if you must.
Just don't call me sir.

129
00:09:56,844 --> 00:09:58,679
All right, Colonel.

130
00:10:00,514 --> 00:10:01,891
Simms, Charles.

131
00:10:01,974 --> 00:10:03,267
A senior.

132
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:05,102
You on student aid, Simms?

133
00:10:05,186 --> 00:10:06,854
Yes, I am.

134
00:10:07,313 --> 00:10:09,273
For student aid read crook.

135
00:10:10,691 --> 00:10:13,944
Your father peddles car telephones
at a 300% markup.

136
00:10:14,028 --> 00:10:16,781
Your mother works on heavy commission
in a camera store.

137
00:10:16,864 --> 00:10:19,783
Graduated to it
from espresso machines.

138
00:10:26,582 --> 00:10:30,085
What are you,
dying of some wasting disease?

139
00:10:32,213 --> 00:10:34,215
No, I'm right... I'm right here.

140
00:10:34,924 --> 00:10:37,676
I know exactly where your body is.

141
00:10:38,052 --> 00:10:41,013
What I'm lookin' for
is some indication of a brain.

142
00:10:42,056 --> 00:10:44,558
Too much football without a helmet?

143
00:10:45,059 --> 00:10:48,395
Lyndon's line on Gerry Ford.

144
00:10:49,813 --> 00:10:53,484
Deputy Debriefer,
Paris, Peace Talks, '68.

145
00:10:53,567 --> 00:10:57,655
Snagged the Silver Star and a silver bar.
Threw me into G-2.

146
00:10:58,447 --> 00:10:59,657
G-2?

147
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:02,910
Intelligence,
of which you have none.

148
00:11:07,122 --> 00:11:08,541
Where you from?

149
00:11:09,208 --> 00:11:10,751
Gresham, Oregon,

150
00:11:12,753 --> 00:11:13,921
Colonel.

151
00:11:14,004 --> 00:11:16,590
What does your daddy do
in Gresham, Oregon?

152
00:11:17,091 --> 00:11:19,009
Count wood chips?

153
00:11:20,135 --> 00:11:23,931
My stepfather and my mom
run a convenience store.

154
00:11:24,014 --> 00:11:27,101
How convenient.
What time they open?

155
00:11:27,935 --> 00:11:29,019
5:00 a.m.

156
00:11:29,103 --> 00:11:30,187
Close?

157
00:11:30,437 --> 00:11:31,605
1:00 a.m.

158
00:11:31,689 --> 00:11:33,524
Hard workers.

159
00:11:33,607 --> 00:11:35,484
You got me all misty-eyed!

160
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:42,616
So, what are you doing here
in this sparrow-fart town?

161
00:11:43,742 --> 00:11:45,870
I attend Baird.

162
00:11:47,329 --> 00:11:48,831
Attend Baird!

163
00:11:50,249 --> 00:11:52,877
I know you go to the Baird school.

164
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:55,879
Point is, how do you afford it,

165
00:11:55,963 --> 00:12:00,676
even with the student aid and the folks
back home hustlin' corn nuts?

166
00:12:01,886 --> 00:12:05,848
I won a Young American
merit scholarship.

167
00:12:09,602 --> 00:12:13,063
<i>Glory, glory, hallelujah</i>

168
00:12:13,606 --> 00:12:17,067
<i>Glory, glory, hallelujah</i>

169
00:12:21,363 --> 00:12:22,489
Who's there?

170
00:12:23,157 --> 00:12:24,867
That little piece of tail?

171
00:12:28,162 --> 00:12:29,914
Get her outta here!

172
00:12:38,589 --> 00:12:39,965
Yeah.

173
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:43,761
Can't believe they're my blood.

174
00:12:49,099 --> 00:12:53,062
IQ of sloths
and the manners of banshees.

175
00:12:53,145 --> 00:12:55,648
He's a mechanic, she's a homemaker.

176
00:12:55,731 --> 00:12:58,108
He knows as much about cars
as a beauty queen,

177
00:12:58,192 --> 00:13:01,278
and she bakes cookies,
taste like wing nuts.

178
00:13:02,029 --> 00:13:04,782
As for the tots, they're twits.

179
00:13:05,532 --> 00:13:08,410
How's your skin, son?
I like my aides to be presentable.

180
00:13:11,705 --> 00:13:13,165
Well, I...

181
00:13:13,248 --> 00:13:14,959
I've had a few zits.

182
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:18,504
But my roommate,
he lent me his clinique

183
00:13:18,587 --> 00:13:20,881
because he's from Chestnut Hill
and he's got...

184
00:13:20,964 --> 00:13:23,634
The History of My Skin,
by Charles Simms.

185
00:13:24,927 --> 00:13:27,054
You patronizing me, peewee?

186
00:13:28,305 --> 00:13:31,058
You givin' me
that old prep school palaver?

187
00:13:32,393 --> 00:13:33,602
Baird School!

188
00:13:35,187 --> 00:13:38,482
A bunch of runny-nosed snots
in tweed jackets

189
00:13:38,565 --> 00:13:41,110
all studyin' to be George Bush.

190
00:13:43,278 --> 00:13:45,197
Well...

191
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:47,992
I believe President Bush
went to Andover, Colonel.

192
00:13:51,412 --> 00:13:53,747
You sharpshootin' me, punk?

193
00:13:55,165 --> 00:13:57,209
Is that what you're doin'?

194
00:13:58,168 --> 00:14:00,421
Don't you sharpshoot me.

195
00:14:00,504 --> 00:14:02,965
You'll give me 40.

196
00:14:03,048 --> 00:14:05,592
Then you're gonna give me 40 more.

197
00:14:05,676 --> 00:14:09,346
Then you're gonna pull K.P.,
the grease pit!

198
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:15,060
I'll rub your nose in enlisted men's crud
till you don't know which end is up!

199
00:14:15,769 --> 00:14:17,062
You understand?

200
00:14:18,397 --> 00:14:19,523
Yeah.

201
00:14:19,606 --> 00:14:20,941
What do you want?

202
00:14:21,108 --> 00:14:23,027
What do you mean, what do I want?

203
00:14:23,110 --> 00:14:24,528
What do you want here?

204
00:14:27,114 --> 00:14:28,949
I want a job.

205
00:14:29,783 --> 00:14:31,618
A job!

206
00:14:31,702 --> 00:14:33,871
Yeah, I want a job
so I can make, you know,

207
00:14:33,954 --> 00:14:36,373
my plane fare home for Christmas.

208
00:14:37,666 --> 00:14:40,753
Oh, God, you're touching!

209
00:15:15,662 --> 00:15:18,165
Still here, poormouth?

210
00:15:20,334 --> 00:15:23,545
Convenience store, my ass!

211
00:15:24,797 --> 00:15:28,842
Hustlin' jalapeno dips
to the appleseeds.

212
00:15:29,968 --> 00:15:31,553
Go on.

213
00:15:32,346 --> 00:15:33,847
Dismissed.

214
00:15:36,975 --> 00:15:38,477
Dismissed!

215
00:15:53,033 --> 00:15:54,451
Mrs. Rossi?

216
00:15:54,910 --> 00:15:57,454
Charlie, we're up here!
Come on up.

217
00:15:59,873 --> 00:16:02,376
- This is Donny.
- Hey, Charlie.

218
00:16:02,793 --> 00:16:04,044
Hi.

219
00:16:04,419 --> 00:16:07,381
Mrs. Rossi,
I got the feelin' I screwed up.

220
00:16:07,589 --> 00:16:09,758
Oh, you couldn't have.

221
00:16:09,842 --> 00:16:11,343
It was a bad interview.

222
00:16:11,426 --> 00:16:13,387
That was no interview, Charlie.
You're it.

223
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,723
You're the only one that showed up.
You have to take the job.

224
00:16:16,807 --> 00:16:21,436
He sleeps a lot. You can watch television,
call your girlfriend.

225
00:16:22,104 --> 00:16:24,064
I promise you, an easy 300 bucks.

226
00:16:25,899 --> 00:16:28,068
I don't get an easy feeling.

227
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:33,240
His bark is worse than his bite.

228
00:16:34,408 --> 00:16:37,744
He was a great soldier, a real hero.

229
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:41,331
The man grows on you.

230
00:16:41,415 --> 00:16:43,500
By Sunday night,
you'll be best friends.

231
00:16:44,751 --> 00:16:47,588
Charlie, please.

232
00:16:48,714 --> 00:16:50,632
I want to get away with my husband
for a few days,

233
00:16:50,716 --> 00:16:53,177
and Uncle Frank won't come with us.

234
00:16:53,635 --> 00:16:56,430
Six months ago,
he could sometimes tell light from dark,

235
00:16:56,513 --> 00:16:58,390
but now there's nothing.

236
00:16:58,473 --> 00:17:01,518
I just feel better having
someone else around just in case.

237
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:09,443
Please?

238
00:17:12,738 --> 00:17:13,947
Okay, Mrs. Rossi.

239
00:17:14,364 --> 00:17:15,490
Sure.

240
00:17:15,908 --> 00:17:17,868
Thank you, Charlie.

241
00:17:17,951 --> 00:17:19,369
Come here, you.

242
00:17:27,628 --> 00:17:29,379
There you go.

243
00:17:29,463 --> 00:17:31,840
Chas. Chas, hold up.

244
00:17:33,759 --> 00:17:35,552
- How you doin'?
- I'm good.

245
00:17:35,636 --> 00:17:36,929
That's great.

246
00:17:37,471 --> 00:17:39,556
This can't go out.
This is on reserve.

247
00:17:43,227 --> 00:17:44,895
Here's the thing.

248
00:17:45,228 --> 00:17:47,773
I need the book tonight

249
00:17:48,607 --> 00:17:51,401
for a Thanksgiving quiz
with big-shit Preston in the morning.

250
00:17:51,485 --> 00:17:53,820
Yeah, I know.
That's why he put it on reserve.

251
00:17:53,904 --> 00:17:55,197
This is our only copy.

252
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:57,616
Chas, I'm pullin' an all-nighter.

253
00:17:57,699 --> 00:18:00,369
Without that book I'm dead, okay?

254
00:18:02,329 --> 00:18:05,749
If it's not back by 7:30,
it's gonna be my ass.

255
00:18:05,832 --> 00:18:07,960
Oh, I promise. I promise.

256
00:18:16,843 --> 00:18:18,845
- Got it?
- Yeah.

257
00:18:33,527 --> 00:18:35,821
Just a second. I gotta lock up.

258
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:41,827
Okay.

259
00:18:43,370 --> 00:18:46,039
God, can you wait to get
out of this dump or what?

260
00:18:51,712 --> 00:18:54,464
Where you guys going skiing again?
Sugarloaf or...

261
00:18:54,548 --> 00:18:56,508
It's Bush, Chas, Sugarbush.

262
00:19:06,685 --> 00:19:08,312
That's my boys.

263
00:19:08,395 --> 00:19:10,313
What are you doin'?

264
00:19:10,397 --> 00:19:13,316
Keep your voice down!

265
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:15,652
I'll tell you about it in the morning.

266
00:19:18,363 --> 00:19:19,740
What...

267
00:19:20,699 --> 00:19:22,200
Mrs. Hunsaker, have a nice day?

268
00:19:22,284 --> 00:19:23,994
George, why all the noise?

269
00:19:25,746 --> 00:19:28,498
It's Hunsaker! Go! Go!

270
00:19:28,582 --> 00:19:30,667
I was just messin' around with Chas.

271
00:19:30,751 --> 00:19:31,918
Good evening, Charles.

272
00:19:32,002 --> 00:19:33,378
Hi, Mrs. Hunsaker.

273
00:19:39,134 --> 00:19:41,303
- What was that?
- I don't know, ma'am.

274
00:19:41,803 --> 00:19:43,013
Who were those boys?

275
00:19:43,096 --> 00:19:44,890
- Oh, who knows?
- What were they doing?

276
00:19:45,098 --> 00:19:46,808
Charles?

277
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:50,520
Did you make this scarf yourself?

278
00:19:50,604 --> 00:19:52,147
No, George, I bought it.

279
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:54,941
- 'Cause it's a beauty. It really is.
- Thank you, George.

280
00:19:55,025 --> 00:19:57,778
In case I don't see you
before the Thanksgiving holidays,

281
00:19:58,195 --> 00:19:59,780
why don't you give me
one of your big hugs?

282
00:19:59,863 --> 00:20:01,281
- Oh, George!
- Please?

283
00:20:01,365 --> 00:20:02,783
- Good evening, boys.
- Come on.

284
00:20:02,866 --> 00:20:04,284
Goodbye, Mrs. Hunsaker.

285
00:20:26,098 --> 00:20:28,975
Mr. Trask is our fearless leader,

286
00:20:30,310 --> 00:20:33,355
a man of learning,
a voracious reader.

287
00:20:34,981 --> 00:20:37,818
He could recite the Iliad
in ancient Greek

288
00:20:38,944 --> 00:20:42,322
while fishing for trout
in a rippling creek.

289
00:20:43,615 --> 00:20:47,661
Endowed with wisdom,
of judgment sound,

290
00:20:48,203 --> 00:20:52,165
nevertheless about him
the questions abound.

291
00:20:58,004 --> 00:21:01,550
How does Mr. Trask
make such wonderful deals?

292
00:21:02,134 --> 00:21:05,720
Why did the trustees
buy him Jaguar wheels?

293
00:21:06,721 --> 00:21:08,515
He wasn't conniving.

294
00:21:09,057 --> 00:21:11,101
He wasn't crass.

295
00:21:11,184 --> 00:21:13,520
He merely puckered his lips

296
00:21:16,356 --> 00:21:18,692
and kissed their ass!

297
00:21:37,043 --> 00:21:38,503
Come on.

298
00:21:38,628 --> 00:21:40,046
Come on.

299
00:21:44,467 --> 00:21:45,594
One more.

300
00:21:45,677 --> 00:21:46,970
One more, come on!

301
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,158
Fuck you!

302
00:22:14,998 --> 00:22:18,376
Mr. Simms, Mr. Willis.

303
00:22:21,588 --> 00:22:25,759
Mrs. Hunsaker says that you gentlemen
were at a vantage point last night

304
00:22:25,842 --> 00:22:29,262
to observe
who was responsible for this

305
00:22:30,305 --> 00:22:31,598
stunt.

306
00:22:37,562 --> 00:22:38,897
Who was it?

307
00:22:40,023 --> 00:22:42,067
I really couldn't tell you, sir.

308
00:22:43,735 --> 00:22:46,738
I thought I saw someone
fooling with the lamppost,

309
00:22:46,821 --> 00:22:51,284
but by the time I pulled focus,
they were gone.

310
00:22:52,285 --> 00:22:53,620
Mr. Simms?

311
00:22:55,455 --> 00:22:56,957
I couldn't say.

312
00:22:59,167 --> 00:23:03,171
That automobile is not just
a possession of mine.

313
00:23:03,255 --> 00:23:08,093
That automobile was presented to me
by the board of trustees.

314
00:23:08,176 --> 00:23:13,390
It is a symbol of the standard of excellence
for which this school is known,

315
00:23:13,473 --> 00:23:16,226
and I will not have it tarnished.

316
00:23:17,269 --> 00:23:18,645
The automobile?

317
00:23:20,647 --> 00:23:22,774
The standard, Mr. Willis.

318
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:28,321
What's your position, Mr. Simms?

319
00:23:29,155 --> 00:23:30,490
On what, sir?

320
00:23:30,574 --> 00:23:32,867
On preserving the reputation of Baird.

321
00:23:33,159 --> 00:23:34,869
I'm for Baird.

322
00:23:35,412 --> 00:23:36,871
Then who did it?

323
00:23:38,206 --> 00:23:40,333
I really couldn't say for sure.

324
00:23:46,006 --> 00:23:47,549
Very well.

325
00:23:55,056 --> 00:23:57,642
First thing Monday,
I'm convening a special session

326
00:23:57,726 --> 00:23:59,978
of the student-faculty
disciplinary committee.

327
00:24:00,061 --> 00:24:02,772
As this is a matter which concerns
the whole school,

328
00:24:02,856 --> 00:24:05,650
the entire student body will be present.

329
00:24:05,734 --> 00:24:08,278
There will be no classes, no activities.

330
00:24:08,361 --> 00:24:13,867
Nothing will transpire at this institution
until that proceeding is concluded.

331
00:24:16,119 --> 00:24:19,372
And if, at that time,
we are no further along than we are now,

332
00:24:21,499 --> 00:24:23,293
I will expel you both.

333
00:24:28,632 --> 00:24:31,259
Mr. Willis, would you excuse us?

334
00:24:35,722 --> 00:24:37,349
Have a nice Thanksgiving.

335
00:24:39,100 --> 00:24:40,769
Thank you.
You too, Mr. Willis.

336
00:24:40,852 --> 00:24:42,145
I will.

337
00:24:49,903 --> 00:24:51,196
Mr. Simms,

338
00:24:53,657 --> 00:24:55,867
I'm not quite through with you yet.

339
00:25:04,667 --> 00:25:07,379
One of the few perks
of this office is that

340
00:25:07,462 --> 00:25:12,592
I am empowered to handle certain matters
on my own as I see fit.

341
00:25:14,427 --> 00:25:16,096
Do you understand?

342
00:25:16,179 --> 00:25:17,764
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

343
00:25:18,223 --> 00:25:21,351
The Dean of Admissions at Harvard
and I have an arrangement.

344
00:25:21,434 --> 00:25:24,688
Along with the usual sheaf of applicants
submitted by Baird,

345
00:25:24,771 --> 00:25:29,776
of which virtually two-thirds
are guaranteed admittance,

346
00:25:30,610 --> 00:25:32,612
I add one name,

347
00:25:34,239 --> 00:25:37,826
somebody who's a standout
and yet underprivileged.

348
00:25:38,993 --> 00:25:43,164
A student who cannot afford to pay
the board and tuition in Cambridge.

349
00:25:45,792 --> 00:25:49,337
Do you know on whose behalf
I drafted a memo this year?

350
00:25:50,547 --> 00:25:51,548
No, sir.

351
00:25:51,631 --> 00:25:52,841
You.

352
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,385
You, Mr. Simms.

353
00:25:58,638 --> 00:26:00,849
Now can you tell me who did it?

354
00:26:03,393 --> 00:26:04,894
No, sir, I can't.

355
00:26:06,271 --> 00:26:09,149
You take the weekend
to think about it, Mr. Simms.

356
00:26:11,609 --> 00:26:13,445
Good afternoon.

357
00:26:16,448 --> 00:26:17,949
What'd he say?

358
00:26:18,408 --> 00:26:20,535
- Nothin'.
- What do you mean, nothing?

359
00:26:20,618 --> 00:26:23,329
He said the same thing.
He just said it over.

360
00:26:23,413 --> 00:26:25,081
You know what he's doing?

361
00:26:25,165 --> 00:26:27,876
He's good-cop, bad-coppin' us.

362
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,628
He knows I'm old guard.
You're fringe.

363
00:26:30,712 --> 00:26:33,339
He's gonna bear down on me
and soft-soap you.

364
00:26:34,424 --> 00:26:37,469
Did he try to soft-soap you?

365
00:26:37,552 --> 00:26:38,720
Did he?

366
00:26:39,512 --> 00:26:40,638
No.

367
00:26:41,764 --> 00:26:44,934
Chas, I detect a slight panic pulse from you.
Are you panicking?

368
00:26:45,018 --> 00:26:46,436
Yeah, a little.

369
00:26:46,519 --> 00:26:48,688
Come on.
You're on scholarship, right?

370
00:26:49,856 --> 00:26:50,940
Yeah.

371
00:26:51,024 --> 00:26:54,152
You're on scholarship
from Oregon at Baird.

372
00:26:55,487 --> 00:26:57,697
You're a long way from home, Chas.

373
00:26:58,364 --> 00:27:00,492
What's that got to do with anything?

374
00:27:00,992 --> 00:27:03,286
I don't know how it works out there.

375
00:27:03,369 --> 00:27:04,954
But how it works here?

376
00:27:05,038 --> 00:27:06,789
We stick together.

377
00:27:06,956 --> 00:27:09,334
It's us against them,
no matter what.

378
00:27:09,417 --> 00:27:11,252
We don't cover our ass.

379
00:27:11,336 --> 00:27:13,338
We don't tell our parents.

380
00:27:13,421 --> 00:27:15,131
Stonewall everybody!

381
00:27:16,257 --> 00:27:20,845
And above all, never, ever

382
00:27:20,929 --> 00:27:24,057
leave any of us
twisting in the wind.

383
00:27:25,809 --> 00:27:27,477
And that's it.

384
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:30,271
What does that have to do with
me being on scholarship?

385
00:27:30,355 --> 00:27:32,190
Hey, hey.

386
00:27:32,273 --> 00:27:35,068
I'm just tryin' to bring you up
to speed, kid, that's it.

387
00:27:36,236 --> 00:27:37,570
Thanks.

388
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,033
I'll tell you what.

389
00:27:42,116 --> 00:27:44,911
Give me a few hours
to figure out the moves,

390
00:27:44,994 --> 00:27:47,163
and call me tonight in Vermont.

391
00:27:48,498 --> 00:27:51,668
I'll be at the Sugarbush lodge,
all right?

392
00:27:51,751 --> 00:27:52,919
All right.

393
00:27:54,379 --> 00:27:55,838
You all right?

394
00:27:57,048 --> 00:27:58,591
Yeah, I guess so.

395
00:28:00,093 --> 00:28:01,427
Okay.

396
00:28:04,013 --> 00:28:06,266
Try to keep him down
to four drinks a day.

397
00:28:06,349 --> 00:28:09,185
If you can keep him down to 40,
you're doin' good.

398
00:28:09,269 --> 00:28:11,854
We try to water them down a little.
Do you know how to do that?

399
00:28:11,938 --> 00:28:13,898
It's a long ride, honey.

400
00:28:14,482 --> 00:28:16,442
Get the bags in the car.
I'll be right out.

401
00:28:16,526 --> 00:28:20,154
Mommy, Mommy,
don't forget Uncle Frank's walk.

402
00:28:21,823 --> 00:28:23,950
Oh, yeah.

403
00:28:26,494 --> 00:28:28,997
You have to air him out
a little every day.

404
00:28:30,915 --> 00:28:33,501
Why don't you go on back there,
get yourself oriented?

405
00:28:33,585 --> 00:28:36,629
I'll come out in a minute,
give you telephone numbers and stuff.

406
00:28:38,965 --> 00:28:42,802
Well, I wouldn't try a thing like that
unless I knew, would I?

407
00:28:43,094 --> 00:28:44,804
Just let me speak to her.

408
00:28:45,138 --> 00:28:47,140
Hello, beautiful. Is that you?

409
00:28:47,223 --> 00:28:49,309
Yeah, we spoke yesterday.

410
00:28:51,978 --> 00:28:55,815
You have a glass of wine with lunch?
You sound a little dusky.

411
00:28:58,318 --> 00:29:00,194
Just a minute, sweetheart.

412
00:29:01,821 --> 00:29:03,323
You're back, huh?

413
00:29:04,574 --> 00:29:05,908
Tenacious!

414
00:29:05,992 --> 00:29:08,953
Get out my dress blues.
They're in a garment bag in the closet.

415
00:29:09,037 --> 00:29:10,580
Check the top dresser drawer.

416
00:29:10,663 --> 00:29:14,083
Take out the shoulder boards and affix them,
shoulders right and left,

417
00:29:14,167 --> 00:29:16,628
ASAP. That means now.

418
00:29:17,837 --> 00:29:19,339
Hello.

419
00:29:19,422 --> 00:29:22,258
Sorry to keep you waiting,
sweetheart.

420
00:29:22,342 --> 00:29:24,969
I'm not the kind of guy
who likes to rush things,

421
00:29:25,053 --> 00:29:27,931
but I'm catchin' a 4:00 at Logan,
I'm lookin' out my window,

422
00:29:28,014 --> 00:29:29,807
and there's not a taxi in sight.

423
00:29:31,017 --> 00:29:32,393
What happened to Chet?

424
00:29:32,518 --> 00:29:34,312
He didn't invest in a radio yet?

425
00:29:36,397 --> 00:29:38,524
Well, get your driver on it.

426
00:29:39,317 --> 00:29:41,611
Tell him to get a move on.

427
00:29:41,694 --> 00:29:44,155
Yes.

428
00:29:45,365 --> 00:29:48,785
Some kind of body has got to go
with that bedroom voice.

429
00:29:48,868 --> 00:29:51,371
One day I'm gonna swing by,
get a better look at it.

430
00:29:52,038 --> 00:29:53,206
You bet.

431
00:29:55,124 --> 00:29:56,376
Bye.

432
00:29:59,128 --> 00:30:01,172
My Valpak's underneath the bed.

433
00:30:01,255 --> 00:30:02,674
Get it out.

434
00:30:02,757 --> 00:30:05,343
Put the boards on the blues
and fold 'em in.

435
00:30:06,511 --> 00:30:08,972
Are we going someplace, Colonel?

436
00:30:09,055 --> 00:30:10,723
What business is that of yours?

437
00:30:11,516 --> 00:30:13,601
Don't shrug, imbecile.
I'm blind.

438
00:30:13,685 --> 00:30:16,062
Save your body language
for the bimbi.

439
00:30:16,938 --> 00:30:18,398
Now, get my gear out.

440
00:30:19,691 --> 00:30:22,068
Francine, get in the car.

441
00:30:22,485 --> 00:30:26,239
It's almost 3:00.
The goddamn Flintstones haven't left yet.

442
00:30:26,864 --> 00:30:29,909
Willie Rossi must go in the car.

443
00:30:31,577 --> 00:30:33,162
Here comes Mrs. Rossi now.

444
00:30:33,246 --> 00:30:34,455
Damn it!

445
00:30:35,248 --> 00:30:37,417
She said goodbye to me
three times today.

446
00:30:38,751 --> 00:30:41,004
What has she got,
separation anxiety?

447
00:30:41,087 --> 00:30:42,922
Cut her off at the door.

448
00:30:45,717 --> 00:30:47,427
Hi, honey. Bye, honey.

449
00:30:52,014 --> 00:30:53,641
I wish you were coming with us.

450
00:30:54,267 --> 00:30:55,518
Me too.

451
00:30:55,601 --> 00:30:56,936
Maybe next time.

452
00:31:01,816 --> 00:31:03,943
- Drive carefully now.
- Yeah.

453
00:31:05,778 --> 00:31:08,239
Charlie, this is where we'll be.

454
00:31:09,657 --> 00:31:12,618
Good luck, Charlie.
Don't let him drink too much.

455
00:31:16,789 --> 00:31:18,332
See you, Charlie.

456
00:31:19,208 --> 00:31:21,961
And no 900 numbers.
He loves to talk dirty.

457
00:31:30,428 --> 00:31:32,472
All right, let's get to work.

458
00:31:41,773 --> 00:31:43,649
L-buckles givin' you trouble?

459
00:31:45,693 --> 00:31:47,904
Never in the Boy Scouts, sluggo?

460
00:31:47,987 --> 00:31:49,655
I made Tenderfoot.

461
00:31:49,739 --> 00:31:51,574
Tenderfoot, my foot!

462
00:31:51,657 --> 00:31:53,993
Convenience store mama's boy.

463
00:31:54,118 --> 00:31:55,995
Here.
Let me take a look at that.

464
00:31:56,954 --> 00:32:00,333
Touch me again, I'll kill you,
you little son of a bitch!

465
00:32:01,626 --> 00:32:03,127
I touch you.

466
00:32:05,213 --> 00:32:06,506
Understand?

467
00:32:08,925 --> 00:32:12,053
My shoulder boards are
in the top dresser drawer.

468
00:32:12,136 --> 00:32:13,471
Get them, son.

469
00:32:13,554 --> 00:32:15,556
The epaulets with the silver oak leaf.

470
00:32:33,449 --> 00:32:35,451
Are these the...

471
00:32:35,743 --> 00:32:37,537
Good. Taxi come yet?

472
00:32:38,996 --> 00:32:41,374
Colonel, where are we going?

473
00:32:41,457 --> 00:32:43,417
Where are we going?

474
00:32:43,501 --> 00:32:45,670
Freak show central.

475
00:32:45,753 --> 00:32:47,713
- Where's that?
- New York City.

476
00:32:50,550 --> 00:32:52,051
That's in New York, son.

477
00:32:52,135 --> 00:32:54,136
New York State.

478
00:32:54,345 --> 00:32:57,098
Mrs. Rossi didn't say anything to me
about going anywhere.

479
00:32:57,181 --> 00:32:58,391
She forgot.

480
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,227
Should we call her, 'cause I...

481
00:33:01,310 --> 00:33:02,895
You kidding me?

482
00:33:02,979 --> 00:33:06,691
Call her? By the time they get to Albany
in that Hupmobile he drives,

483
00:33:06,774 --> 00:33:09,026
it'll be opening day at Saratoga.

484
00:33:09,485 --> 00:33:11,320
Colonel, I can't go to New York City.

485
00:33:11,404 --> 00:33:12,572
Why not?

486
00:33:13,865 --> 00:33:15,241
New York...

487
00:33:15,741 --> 00:33:17,577
New York's too much responsibility.

488
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:19,495
Ah, responsibility!

489
00:33:19,579 --> 00:33:22,290
I had a lot of 17-year-olds
in my first platoon.

490
00:33:22,373 --> 00:33:24,584
I took care of them.
All set!

491
00:33:27,044 --> 00:33:28,296
How do I look?

492
00:33:30,256 --> 00:33:31,924
Tickets. Money.

493
00:33:32,592 --> 00:33:33,801
Speech.

494
00:33:34,635 --> 00:33:37,972
Old Washington joke
from my days with Lyndon.

495
00:33:40,266 --> 00:33:42,268
I knew I could count
on transportation.

496
00:33:42,351 --> 00:33:43,686
Are you ready?

497
00:33:46,230 --> 00:33:48,774
This is not Panmunjom.
A simple yes will do.

498
00:33:49,901 --> 00:33:51,611
Good! Here you go.

499
00:33:51,944 --> 00:33:53,529
Come on! Hop to, son!

500
00:33:54,947 --> 00:33:56,657
You're in front of me.
Let's go.

501
00:33:58,576 --> 00:34:00,369
Tomster, come here, boy.

502
00:34:02,288 --> 00:34:03,497
Come on.

503
00:34:03,581 --> 00:34:05,541
Here, Tomster, come on.

504
00:34:05,625 --> 00:34:07,919
Tomster, Tomster. Yeah.

505
00:34:09,128 --> 00:34:12,256
Remember, when in doubt,

506
00:34:12,965 --> 00:34:14,091
fuck.

507
00:34:17,428 --> 00:34:19,764
Good afternoon, sir.
Where's our destination?

508
00:34:19,847 --> 00:34:23,017
Our destination, New York City,
home of the brave!

509
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:25,061
We got two
for the shuttle to New York.

510
00:34:25,144 --> 00:34:28,105
I'm not shuttling anywhere.
Look at those tickets. First class.

511
00:34:28,189 --> 00:34:29,899
Yes, sir, first class.

512
00:34:29,982 --> 00:34:31,984
Colonel, you bought me a ticket?

513
00:34:32,068 --> 00:34:33,736
I never said I'd go to New York.

514
00:34:33,819 --> 00:34:37,782
Oh, what are you, some kind of chicken-shit,
sticks to job description only?

515
00:34:37,865 --> 00:34:39,742
Gate 46, sir.

516
00:34:39,825 --> 00:34:41,327
As you were, son.

517
00:34:41,410 --> 00:34:42,912
Thank you, sir.

518
00:34:42,995 --> 00:34:44,455
Which way's the door?

519
00:34:45,623 --> 00:34:48,626
Are you blind? Are you blind?

520
00:34:48,709 --> 00:34:49,961
Of course not.

521
00:34:50,044 --> 00:34:52,505
Then why do you keep grabbin'
my goddamn arm?

522
00:34:52,964 --> 00:34:55,174
I take your arm.

523
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:01,722
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry.

524
00:35:01,806 --> 00:35:04,350
How would you know,
watchin' MTV all your life?

525
00:35:04,433 --> 00:35:06,519
- Gentlemen?
- Yeah!

526
00:35:09,146 --> 00:35:11,232
- Jack Daniels.
- You bet.

527
00:35:13,192 --> 00:35:15,027
And Diet Slice.

528
00:35:15,111 --> 00:35:16,362
The old Diet Slice.

529
00:35:16,445 --> 00:35:17,822
And a water.

530
00:35:17,905 --> 00:35:20,116
- Thank you, Daphne.
- Certainly, sir.

531
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:30,209
How did you know her name?

532
00:35:31,919 --> 00:35:34,588
Well, she's wearin' Floris.

533
00:35:35,548 --> 00:35:37,383
That's an English cologne.

534
00:35:38,592 --> 00:35:41,887
But her voice is California chickie.

535
00:35:42,722 --> 00:35:45,850
Now, California chickie
bucking for English lady.

536
00:35:46,642 --> 00:35:48,060
I call her Daphne.

537
00:35:50,313 --> 00:35:53,983
Oh, big things may happen
to that little thing of yours.

538
00:35:56,235 --> 00:35:57,486
Look, Colonel,

539
00:35:59,322 --> 00:36:01,532
I'll get you to New York, all right?

540
00:36:01,615 --> 00:36:04,410
Then I'm gonna have to
turn around and come back.

541
00:36:04,952 --> 00:36:07,246
Well, Chuck,
you gotta do what you gotta do.

542
00:36:08,247 --> 00:36:09,749
Charlie, all right?

543
00:36:10,291 --> 00:36:11,542
Or Charles.

544
00:36:11,625 --> 00:36:13,919
Sorry.
I can't blame you though.

545
00:36:14,003 --> 00:36:15,254
Chuck is a...

546
00:36:19,091 --> 00:36:21,302
So, why are we going to New York?

547
00:36:21,385 --> 00:36:24,930
All information will be given
on a need-to-know basis.

548
00:36:28,267 --> 00:36:30,478
Where's Daphne?
Let's get her down here.

549
00:36:33,439 --> 00:36:35,024
She's in the back.

550
00:36:35,733 --> 00:36:37,151
A tail's in the tail.

551
00:36:40,488 --> 00:36:42,031
Oh, but I still smell her.

552
00:36:46,035 --> 00:36:47,203
Women.

553
00:36:48,621 --> 00:36:50,289
What can you say?

554
00:36:51,749 --> 00:36:53,250
Who made 'em?

555
00:36:54,460 --> 00:36:56,962
God must have been a fuckin' genius.

556
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:02,676
The hair...

557
00:37:04,011 --> 00:37:06,222
They say the hair is everything,
you know.

558
00:37:08,307 --> 00:37:12,019
Have you ever buried your nose
in a mountain of curls

559
00:37:12,478 --> 00:37:15,606
and just wanted to go
to sleep forever?

560
00:37:17,316 --> 00:37:18,818
Or lips,

561
00:37:21,028 --> 00:37:23,072
and when they touched,
yours were like

562
00:37:23,155 --> 00:37:26,325
that first swallow of wine

563
00:37:26,867 --> 00:37:29,328
after you just crossed the desert.

564
00:37:32,998 --> 00:37:34,125
Tits!

565
00:37:36,669 --> 00:37:39,171
Big ones, little ones,

566
00:37:40,089 --> 00:37:44,635
nipples staring right out at you
like secret searchlights.

567
00:37:49,473 --> 00:37:50,683
And legs...

568
00:37:52,184 --> 00:37:55,187
I don't care if they're Greek columns

569
00:37:55,563 --> 00:37:57,440
or secondhand Steinways.

570
00:37:58,983 --> 00:38:00,359
What's between 'em,

571
00:38:02,570 --> 00:38:04,155
passport to heaven.

572
00:38:06,031 --> 00:38:07,616
I need a drink.

573
00:38:11,579 --> 00:38:12,955
Yes, Mr. Simms,

574
00:38:14,957 --> 00:38:19,253
there's only two syllables
in this whole wide world worth hearing.

575
00:38:24,842 --> 00:38:26,051
Pussy.

576
00:38:28,971 --> 00:38:31,807
Are you listening to me, son?
I'm givin' you pearls here.

577
00:38:33,809 --> 00:38:35,603
I guess you really like women.

578
00:38:35,686 --> 00:38:38,230
Oh, above all things!

579
00:38:44,111 --> 00:38:47,531
A very, very distant second

580
00:38:49,575 --> 00:38:50,868
is a Ferrari.

581
00:38:58,751 --> 00:38:59,877
Charlie?

582
00:39:02,838 --> 00:39:04,131
Give me your hand.

583
00:39:06,383 --> 00:39:09,261
This is just the start of
your education, son.

584
00:39:26,946 --> 00:39:28,322
Where are we?

585
00:39:28,405 --> 00:39:29,865
Where are we, eh?

586
00:39:30,449 --> 00:39:33,494
The cynosure of all things civilized.

587
00:39:33,702 --> 00:39:35,621
The Waldorf-Astoria.

588
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:40,334
The last time I was here, Charlie,
was with a G-2 from Brussels.

589
00:39:40,417 --> 00:39:41,835
Had a Ferrari.

590
00:39:41,919 --> 00:39:45,214
Every day I held the door open
for the fucker.

591
00:39:45,297 --> 00:39:47,466
Never even offered me a ride.

592
00:39:47,549 --> 00:39:49,468
Well, fuck him.

593
00:39:49,551 --> 00:39:51,637
He's dead and I'm blind.

594
00:39:55,474 --> 00:39:56,976
Spread the word.

595
00:39:57,059 --> 00:39:58,227
Thank you, sir.

596
00:39:58,310 --> 00:40:00,229
And the intelligence will be forthcoming?

597
00:40:00,312 --> 00:40:01,480
Sir?

598
00:40:01,564 --> 00:40:02,982
On the escort scene.

599
00:40:04,692 --> 00:40:05,901
Yes, sir.

600
00:40:05,985 --> 00:40:07,945
And welcome to the Waldorf.

601
00:40:08,028 --> 00:40:09,363
Gracias, amigo.

602
00:40:11,198 --> 00:40:12,658
Puerto Ricans.

603
00:40:12,741 --> 00:40:14,576
Always made the best infantrymen.

604
00:40:30,342 --> 00:40:31,510
I'm home again.

605
00:40:32,511 --> 00:40:34,680
Give me an inventory on this, will you?

606
00:40:40,853 --> 00:40:42,938
All right, where am I, in Asia?

607
00:40:43,022 --> 00:40:46,108
He told me the phone was on
the other side of the room, didn't he?

608
00:40:46,191 --> 00:40:47,568
By the windows?

609
00:40:49,111 --> 00:40:50,404
It's right here.

610
00:40:52,197 --> 00:40:53,532
Okay.

611
00:40:54,325 --> 00:40:55,576
We're in business.

612
00:41:00,539 --> 00:41:01,874
Get me the Oak Room.

613
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:05,669
How's that inventory comin'?

614
00:41:06,795 --> 00:41:09,548
There's Jim Beam

615
00:41:09,631 --> 00:41:12,134
and Early Times.

616
00:41:12,217 --> 00:41:14,053
Quartermaster's on the take again.

617
00:41:14,470 --> 00:41:17,222
Hello.
Is Sheldon or Mack there?

618
00:41:18,932 --> 00:41:21,352
This is Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade.

619
00:41:21,435 --> 00:41:24,813
I used to be a regular.
I used to come in with a General Garbisch.

620
00:41:26,982 --> 00:41:30,110
Yes, that's probably because
he's at Arlington, six feet under.

621
00:41:30,194 --> 00:41:33,697
Listen up. I want a table for two,
and I don't mean Siberia,

622
00:41:34,156 --> 00:41:35,240
8:15.

623
00:41:36,575 --> 00:41:38,369
Clear them little bottles off.

624
00:41:38,452 --> 00:41:42,206
And when I get off the phone,
call up Hyman.

625
00:41:42,289 --> 00:41:45,250
Tell him I want it wall to wall
with John Daniels.

626
00:41:45,751 --> 00:41:48,629
Don't you mean Jack Daniels?

627
00:41:48,712 --> 00:41:52,508
He may be Jack to you, son. But when
you've known him as long as I have...

628
00:41:52,591 --> 00:41:53,967
That's a joke. Hello!

629
00:41:54,051 --> 00:41:57,054
This is Lieutenant Colonel Frank Slade.
I would like a limo,

630
00:41:57,137 --> 00:41:58,472
8:00.

631
00:42:05,479 --> 00:42:07,356
What are you drinkin'?

632
00:42:07,439 --> 00:42:10,609
Nothing, thanks. I don't use it.

633
00:42:10,693 --> 00:42:12,528
What's useful about it?

634
00:42:14,113 --> 00:42:17,408
I don't know.
Listen, Colonel, I have to get going.

635
00:42:18,283 --> 00:42:19,827
Where you goin'?

636
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:24,415
Back to school. I've got some real
important stuff I have to take care of.

637
00:42:24,873 --> 00:42:26,375
Very well.

638
00:42:27,376 --> 00:42:30,546
But I never let my aides leave
on an empty stomach.

639
00:42:30,629 --> 00:42:34,091
You'll dine with me
and then my driver will transport you

640
00:42:34,174 --> 00:42:37,261
to the airport for the Boston shuttle
departing at 2200 hours.

641
00:42:38,804 --> 00:42:42,224
Meanwhile, unpack my bag.

642
00:42:42,725 --> 00:42:44,351
I'm gonna christen the latrine.

643
00:42:46,937 --> 00:42:48,772
What's your name, driver?

644
00:42:48,856 --> 00:42:49,982
Manny, sir.

645
00:42:50,065 --> 00:42:55,028
Manny. The bellhops at the Waldorf,
are they any good at getting escorts?

646
00:42:55,112 --> 00:42:57,072
I wouldn't know, sir.

647
00:42:57,156 --> 00:42:58,615
What would you know?

648
00:42:58,699 --> 00:43:00,534
About what?

649
00:43:00,617 --> 00:43:02,327
About you-know-what?

650
00:43:03,829 --> 00:43:06,457
Maybe I could manage something.

651
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:08,917
I'm talkin' top of the line now.

652
00:43:09,001 --> 00:43:10,711
Let me think about this, sir.

653
00:43:19,428 --> 00:43:21,889
What's the matter with you?

654
00:43:21,972 --> 00:43:23,182
With me?

655
00:43:23,265 --> 00:43:25,893
Yeah. Car feels heavy.
You know why?

656
00:43:25,976 --> 00:43:28,854
You got the fuckin' weight of the world
on your shoulders.

657
00:43:33,358 --> 00:43:35,569
I got a little problem at school,
that's all.

658
00:43:35,652 --> 00:43:36,945
Spit it out!

659
00:43:37,029 --> 00:43:38,614
It's not a big deal, all right?

660
00:43:38,697 --> 00:43:40,657
Where we going,
the Oak Room or somethin'?

661
00:43:40,741 --> 00:43:43,452
If it's not a big deal,
why did you say real important stuff?

662
00:43:43,535 --> 00:43:46,705
What are you doin',
banging the dean's daughter?

663
00:43:49,041 --> 00:43:50,834
I'm just in a little trouble.

664
00:43:50,918 --> 00:43:52,377
What kind of trouble?

665
00:43:53,086 --> 00:43:55,047
I saw some guys doing something.

666
00:43:57,549 --> 00:44:00,969
To tell or not to tell, or it's your ass.

667
00:44:05,098 --> 00:44:06,308
How'd you know that?

668
00:44:06,391 --> 00:44:09,019
I'm a wizard.
Give me the details, come on.

669
00:44:15,275 --> 00:44:17,194
There's this guy at school named Harry.

670
00:44:17,277 --> 00:44:21,114
He's this real rich kid,
and he like, runs the show.

671
00:44:21,907 --> 00:44:23,242
Who else?

672
00:44:24,743 --> 00:44:28,956
There's another guy, George,
but George didn't do anything.

673
00:44:29,039 --> 00:44:32,918
George and I saw Harry and
his buddies doin' somethin'.

674
00:44:33,001 --> 00:44:35,045
Now, the folks at Baird,

675
00:44:35,128 --> 00:44:38,257
they know you and George
can identify the guilty parties?

676
00:44:42,219 --> 00:44:43,262
Yeah, they think we can.

677
00:44:44,096 --> 00:44:45,138
George is a friend of yours.

678
00:44:46,431 --> 00:44:48,183
He's not a friend, but he's all right.

679
00:44:48,267 --> 00:44:49,685
You trust him?

680
00:44:50,561 --> 00:44:51,770
Yeah, I guess so.

681
00:44:51,979 --> 00:44:54,398
He's on scholarship too?

682
00:44:55,524 --> 00:44:56,817
No, why?

683
00:44:57,150 --> 00:45:00,195
We got George, we got Harry,
we got trouble.

684
00:45:00,279 --> 00:45:03,115
They're rich, you're poor.
You wanna get rich.

685
00:45:03,198 --> 00:45:06,577
You wanna graduate Baird,
become a rich big shot like them.

686
00:45:06,660 --> 00:45:08,078
- Am I right?
- No.

687
00:45:08,161 --> 00:45:09,955
It's not that way at all.

688
00:45:10,581 --> 00:45:12,124
Okay, Charlie!

689
00:45:13,959 --> 00:45:16,461
Here we are, gentlemen, the Oak Room.

690
00:45:16,962 --> 00:45:18,547
The Oak Room!

691
00:45:19,089 --> 00:45:22,050
Bring us a menu
and double Jack Daniels on the rocks.

692
00:45:22,134 --> 00:45:24,052
Charlie, sit down here.

693
00:45:24,136 --> 00:45:26,930
Perhaps you'll feel more
comfortable in this, sir.

694
00:45:31,977 --> 00:45:35,314
You look great!

695
00:45:39,943 --> 00:45:41,570
Thank you.

696
00:45:42,696 --> 00:45:45,866
Here we are, Charlie, the Oak Room.

697
00:45:46,658 --> 00:45:49,119
Now, read me the bill of fare.

698
00:45:49,870 --> 00:45:51,413
Let's see.

699
00:45:51,830 --> 00:45:54,833
You got the Oak Room
burger and fries for $24.

700
00:45:54,917 --> 00:45:56,543
Where's the booze?

701
00:45:56,627 --> 00:45:58,170
Flowin' like mud around here.

702
00:45:58,253 --> 00:45:59,713
A $24 hamburger?

703
00:46:01,256 --> 00:46:02,507
What's the story?

704
00:46:02,674 --> 00:46:04,176
What story?

705
00:46:05,552 --> 00:46:07,471
Are you a rich miser or something?

706
00:46:09,222 --> 00:46:11,683
No, I'm just your average blind man.

707
00:46:11,767 --> 00:46:13,518
Your average blind man.

708
00:46:14,519 --> 00:46:17,230
How do you plan on
paying for all this stuff?

709
00:46:17,856 --> 00:46:19,733
Crisp, clean dollars.

710
00:46:20,108 --> 00:46:21,276
American.

711
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:23,320
I saved up my disability checks.

712
00:46:23,528 --> 00:46:26,615
How much did you save?
I mean, we flew first class,

713
00:46:26,698 --> 00:46:30,035
we're at the Waldorf-Astoria,
a $24 hamburger restaurant.

714
00:46:30,118 --> 00:46:32,037
All part of a plan, Charlie.

715
00:46:32,496 --> 00:46:33,747
You want to let me in on it?

716
00:46:33,830 --> 00:46:36,583
Why should I? You're not interested.
You don't give a shit!

717
00:46:36,667 --> 00:46:40,963
You're leavin' on that last shuttle
out of LaGuardia.

718
00:46:44,675 --> 00:46:48,178
You got 15 minutes, son.
I don't think you're gonna make it.

719
00:46:48,261 --> 00:46:52,432
Unless the Oak Room keeps some
complimentary helicopter on the roof.

720
00:46:52,891 --> 00:46:54,685
No, sir. No!

721
00:46:55,894 --> 00:46:57,813
You're here till tomorrow.

722
00:46:59,231 --> 00:47:01,525
You said the last shuttle
leaves at 2200 hours.

723
00:47:01,608 --> 00:47:03,568
That's 10:00, right?

724
00:47:04,361 --> 00:47:06,071
Last I heard, yeah.

725
00:47:06,780 --> 00:47:08,407
It's only 8:30.

726
00:47:08,824 --> 00:47:10,909
I lied. Leaves at 9:00.

727
00:47:11,618 --> 00:47:13,036
It leaves at 9:00?

728
00:47:13,203 --> 00:47:14,871
Calm down. Calm down.

729
00:47:18,375 --> 00:47:20,252
The truth is, Charlie,

730
00:47:22,170 --> 00:47:25,757
I need a guide dog
to help me execute my plan.

731
00:47:26,007 --> 00:47:27,551
What plan?

732
00:47:28,927 --> 00:47:30,637
You have a right to know.

733
00:47:32,305 --> 00:47:35,100
It's not really a plan, Charlie.
It's sort of a...

734
00:47:35,642 --> 00:47:37,602
More like a tour,

735
00:47:38,228 --> 00:47:40,647
a little tour of pleasures.

736
00:47:41,314 --> 00:47:45,068
Stay in a first-class hotel,
eat an agreeable meal,

737
00:47:45,861 --> 00:47:48,113
drink a nice glass of wine,

738
00:47:49,698 --> 00:47:51,324
see my big brother.

739
00:47:51,408 --> 00:47:54,077
Nothing like family, you know.

740
00:47:54,161 --> 00:47:58,123
And then,
make love to a terrific woman.

741
00:48:00,459 --> 00:48:01,877
After that...

742
00:48:07,799 --> 00:48:09,092
Yeah?

743
00:48:11,511 --> 00:48:15,974
I'm gonna lie down on my big,
beautiful bed at the Waldorf

744
00:48:16,224 --> 00:48:17,893
and blow my brains out.

745
00:48:21,813 --> 00:48:23,565
May I tell you our specials?

746
00:48:23,648 --> 00:48:25,150
You may, sir.

747
00:48:25,692 --> 00:48:30,030
Tonight we have charred venison with
buckwheat spaetzle and green peppercorn.

748
00:48:30,113 --> 00:48:33,742
Grilled veal paillards,
tomato tapenade, and roasted eggplants.

749
00:48:33,825 --> 00:48:35,702
Get me a napkin.
My mouth's watering.

750
00:48:35,786 --> 00:48:37,996
If you would like our
crème soufflé for dessert,

751
00:48:38,080 --> 00:48:39,998
it would be a good idea
to order now.

752
00:48:40,082 --> 00:48:44,044
Yes, on the soufflé.
Give us a half a minute on the rest.

753
00:48:44,419 --> 00:48:45,879
Very good, sir.

754
00:48:50,175 --> 00:48:52,010
I'm leaning towards the spaetzle.

755
00:48:52,094 --> 00:48:55,430
- Colonel Slade...
- Charlie, rolls on the table?

756
00:48:55,514 --> 00:48:56,681
Give 'em to me.

757
00:48:56,765 --> 00:48:58,975
You should try these rolls, Charlie.

758
00:48:59,059 --> 00:49:02,604
I used to dream about them
when I was at Fort Huachuca.

759
00:49:02,687 --> 00:49:05,357
- Colonel Slade...
- Bread's no good west of the Colorado.

760
00:49:05,440 --> 00:49:07,234
Water's too alkaline.

761
00:49:07,317 --> 00:49:08,777
Colonel Slade, did you say...

762
00:49:10,487 --> 00:49:12,280
Did I hear you right?

763
00:49:13,615 --> 00:49:15,951
You said you're gonna kill yourself?

764
00:49:16,034 --> 00:49:17,327
No.

765
00:49:17,410 --> 00:49:19,371
I said I was gonna blow my brains out.

766
00:49:20,872 --> 00:49:22,666
Try one of these rolls, Charlie.

767
00:49:22,749 --> 00:49:24,709
I buttered it for you.

768
00:49:25,377 --> 00:49:26,878
I don't want a roll, all right?

769
00:49:26,962 --> 00:49:28,713
Okay. Have a radish!

770
00:49:32,342 --> 00:49:36,429
Hello! Bring me a double Jack Daniels
on the rocks.

771
00:49:36,513 --> 00:49:37,806
Yes, sir. Right away.

772
00:49:41,935 --> 00:49:44,312
Please, don't do that.

773
00:49:45,522 --> 00:49:47,065
Don't do that.

774
00:49:58,201 --> 00:49:59,995
What a marvelous place.

775
00:50:03,748 --> 00:50:05,083
Okay.

776
00:50:08,503 --> 00:50:09,629
Yeah.

777
00:50:12,340 --> 00:50:14,426
Your billet is here.

778
00:50:14,968 --> 00:50:17,971
You'll find bedding
in the closet on the shelf.

779
00:50:19,014 --> 00:50:23,018
In the morning, the area will be
returned to sitting-room mode

780
00:50:23,101 --> 00:50:25,437
no later than 0700 hours.

781
00:50:29,524 --> 00:50:30,901
What was that?

782
00:50:33,570 --> 00:50:34,779
Nothing.

783
00:50:35,864 --> 00:50:38,867
Next time snap it out!

784
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:45,415
Thumb to palm, index finger
through little digit, smartly aligned,

785
00:50:46,750 --> 00:50:49,336
sharp to the hairline, down!

786
00:50:53,965 --> 00:50:58,345
Too many men, far better than you,
have executed that courtesy.

787
00:50:59,012 --> 00:51:02,140
And if you're smart,
you won't try it again.

788
00:51:06,269 --> 00:51:10,649
This bat has got sharper radar
than the Nautilus.

789
00:51:11,149 --> 00:51:13,610
Don't fuck with me, Charlie.

790
00:51:24,704 --> 00:51:27,207
See you get a good night's sleep, son.

791
00:51:39,386 --> 00:51:42,013
<i>It's a lovely day today</i>

792
00:51:42,097 --> 00:51:44,933
<i>So, whatever you gotta do</i>

793
00:51:45,016 --> 00:51:48,269
<i>You got a lovely day to do it in,
that's true</i>

794
00:51:54,776 --> 00:51:56,778
Good morning, Charlie.

795
00:51:59,072 --> 00:52:00,824
Good morning.

796
00:52:01,157 --> 00:52:02,909
This is Sofia, Charlie.

797
00:52:03,034 --> 00:52:05,287
She's a magician with a needle.

798
00:52:05,370 --> 00:52:08,373
Sofia's workin' me up
a little Glen Plaid number,

799
00:52:08,498 --> 00:52:11,668
and I've asked her if she'd put
something together for you.

800
00:52:11,751 --> 00:52:13,962
I don't need any clothes, Colonel.

801
00:52:14,045 --> 00:52:17,132
Standard issue for an upscale
urban assignment.

802
00:52:17,424 --> 00:52:20,010
You don't like the clothes, Charlie,
on completion of duty,

803
00:52:20,093 --> 00:52:22,137
you can give 'em away.

804
00:52:22,429 --> 00:52:25,807
Juice, coffee, and other assorted goodies
on the trolley over there.

805
00:52:25,890 --> 00:52:28,101
Get yourself up,
get yourself together.

806
00:52:29,227 --> 00:52:32,313
<i>It's a great day
for singin' a song</i>

807
00:52:32,397 --> 00:52:35,734
<i>And it's a great day
for movin' along</i>

808
00:52:35,817 --> 00:52:38,403
<i>And it's a great day
from morning to night</i>

809
00:52:38,486 --> 00:52:40,488
<i>And it's a great day</i>

810
00:52:41,906 --> 00:52:43,658
<i>For everybody's plight</i>

811
00:52:50,165 --> 00:52:52,042
How are you feeling today, Colonel?

812
00:52:52,125 --> 00:52:53,418
Super!

813
00:52:53,501 --> 00:52:55,045
Superior!

814
00:52:55,128 --> 00:52:56,755
Superfluous!

815
00:52:58,131 --> 00:53:00,467
Young Sofie here is working Thanksgiving

816
00:53:00,884 --> 00:53:03,053
because she's trying to put
herself through college.

817
00:53:03,136 --> 00:53:06,181
I told her, my young friend Charlie's
headed for college.

818
00:53:06,264 --> 00:53:07,807
Excuse me.

819
00:53:07,891 --> 00:53:09,100
Where you goin'?

820
00:53:09,184 --> 00:53:10,810
I need to use the phone.

821
00:53:10,894 --> 00:53:13,104
What's wrong with the phones in here?

822
00:53:13,646 --> 00:53:15,273
I don't want to disturb you.

823
00:53:15,357 --> 00:53:17,942
You're not disturbing me.
Make your call.

824
00:53:18,568 --> 00:53:19,694
I'd kind of like to be private.

825
00:53:19,778 --> 00:53:21,446
Stay out of my room!

826
00:53:22,655 --> 00:53:24,741
This is as private as you're gonna get.

827
00:53:27,827 --> 00:53:31,873
<i>But if you've got somethin'
that must be done</i>

828
00:53:32,665 --> 00:53:36,127
<i>And it can only be done by one</i>

829
00:53:37,962 --> 00:53:39,172
Sofia,

830
00:53:40,757 --> 00:53:43,259
what are the chances of
suitin' you up sometime?

831
00:53:44,928 --> 00:53:47,972
- Sugarbush Lodge.
- George Willis, please.

832
00:53:50,767 --> 00:53:51,893
Hello.

833
00:53:51,976 --> 00:53:53,561
George!
Hey, it's Charlie.

834
00:53:54,104 --> 00:53:57,273
Hey, Chas.
Next year you gotta come up with us.

835
00:53:57,690 --> 00:54:00,652
White powder on a base of snow bunnies.

836
00:54:02,278 --> 00:54:04,364
Chas, are you there?

837
00:54:04,989 --> 00:54:06,741
Yeah, I'm here.

838
00:54:06,825 --> 00:54:09,160
You told me to call you for the moves.

839
00:54:09,244 --> 00:54:10,495
All right.

840
00:54:10,578 --> 00:54:13,915
For now, the move's no move, status quo.

841
00:54:13,998 --> 00:54:15,708
Everything's the way we left it.

842
00:54:15,792 --> 00:54:17,252
How did we leave it?

843
00:54:18,086 --> 00:54:21,089
See no evil, hear no evil.

844
00:54:22,090 --> 00:54:24,050
You know what I mean, Chas?

845
00:54:25,677 --> 00:54:28,513
Yeah.
See no evil, hear no evil.

846
00:54:30,849 --> 00:54:32,976
Okay, then walk like you talk.

847
00:54:33,059 --> 00:54:35,311
All right, bye.

848
00:54:36,229 --> 00:54:38,022
George Willis, huh?

849
00:54:39,023 --> 00:54:40,191
Yeah.

850
00:54:40,942 --> 00:54:42,443
George Willis.

851
00:54:42,527 --> 00:54:45,780
That makes his father probably
George Willis, Senior.

852
00:54:46,865 --> 00:54:48,783
Charlie, I ask you,

853
00:54:48,867 --> 00:54:52,787
what do you think big George
is gonna feel about little George

854
00:54:52,871 --> 00:54:55,915
seeing no evil, hearing no evil?

855
00:54:58,459 --> 00:55:00,587
Well, we're not gonna tell
our parents.

856
00:55:00,795 --> 00:55:03,715
We're just gonna keep it
between ourselves.

857
00:55:04,382 --> 00:55:07,218
Oh, George isn't gonna tell his father
about this thing!

858
00:55:08,011 --> 00:55:09,179
Damn decent of him.

859
00:55:10,972 --> 00:55:13,016
- Scusi, Colonnello.
- Prego.

860
00:55:13,099 --> 00:55:14,893
I love it when you hurt me.

861
00:55:16,436 --> 00:55:18,229
Tell me now, Charlie.

862
00:55:18,313 --> 00:55:22,275
This George Willis, Jr.,
what's his father do?

863
00:55:23,234 --> 00:55:24,736
I don't really know.

864
00:55:24,819 --> 00:55:26,654
Well, I'm gonna tell you.

865
00:55:27,030 --> 00:55:28,823
When George Willis, Senior,

866
00:55:28,907 --> 00:55:31,618
isn't busy as a million-dollar man
for Aetna Casualty...

867
00:55:31,701 --> 00:55:35,496
Or is it New England distributor
for the Chrysler Corporation?

868
00:55:35,580 --> 00:55:39,584
He concerns himself with
his young son, George Willis, Jr.

869
00:55:40,543 --> 00:55:42,921
George isn't going to say anything
to his father.

870
00:55:43,004 --> 00:55:44,756
Oh, Charlie.

871
00:55:45,215 --> 00:55:47,467
Big George is gonna wind up
little George,

872
00:55:47,550 --> 00:55:50,553
and little George is gonna
sing like a canary.

873
00:55:50,637 --> 00:55:53,139
And if you're hip, kid,
you're gonna hop to too.

874
00:55:53,556 --> 00:55:55,683
You've got this all figured out,
don't you?

875
00:55:55,767 --> 00:55:59,854
It don't take no Young American merit
scholarship to figure this one out.

876
00:55:59,938 --> 00:56:01,981
Charlie, you had a little life,

877
00:56:02,065 --> 00:56:06,861
so you decided to go to the Baird school
to put yourself in the market for a big one.

878
00:56:06,945 --> 00:56:08,821
Now, in order to stay in the running,

879
00:56:08,905 --> 00:56:12,742
you're gonna have to tell these people
what they want to know.

880
00:56:13,284 --> 00:56:14,536
You think so?

881
00:56:14,619 --> 00:56:15,662
Are we finished, Sofia?

882
00:56:15,745 --> 00:56:17,413
- Yes.
- Grazie. Grazie. Andate.

883
00:56:20,875 --> 00:56:22,418
Charlie,

884
00:56:23,586 --> 00:56:25,797
if you don't sing now,

885
00:56:26,464 --> 00:56:29,842
you're gonna end up,
not only shelving biscuits

886
00:56:29,926 --> 00:56:32,887
in some convenience store
in the Oregon 'burbs,

887
00:56:32,971 --> 00:56:35,807
but probably the last word
you'll ever hear yourself say

888
00:56:35,890 --> 00:56:38,101
just before you croak,
gonna be...

889
00:56:38,184 --> 00:56:41,980
Have a nice day and come back soon.

890
00:56:42,063 --> 00:56:43,898
Sofia!

891
00:56:43,982 --> 00:56:45,733
Measure up Charlie here, pronto.

892
00:56:45,817 --> 00:56:47,777
We got a date for Thanksgiving.

893
00:56:48,444 --> 00:56:49,696
We got a date?

894
00:56:49,988 --> 00:56:51,823
My brother's place.

895
00:56:51,948 --> 00:56:55,118
W.R. Slade, White Plains, New York.

896
00:56:55,785 --> 00:56:58,162
Colonel, I can't go with you
to your brother's place.

897
00:56:58,329 --> 00:57:01,332
I mean,
I should be getting back to school.

898
00:57:04,210 --> 00:57:07,922
Well, you gotta have
Thanksgiving somewhere.

899
00:57:08,006 --> 00:57:10,091
I mean, eats and treats.

900
00:57:10,174 --> 00:57:12,010
I can use the company, Charlie.

901
00:57:15,513 --> 00:57:16,889
All right.

902
00:57:16,973 --> 00:57:18,433
Does he know I'm comin'?

903
00:57:18,516 --> 00:57:19,934
He doesn't know I'm comin'.

904
00:57:20,018 --> 00:57:23,438
But wait till you see the look on his face
when I walk through the door.

905
00:57:23,521 --> 00:57:25,064
Oh, he loves me!

906
00:57:27,358 --> 00:57:31,237
Oh, Charlie,
about your little problem,

907
00:57:31,321 --> 00:57:33,906
there are two kinds of people
in this world.

908
00:57:33,990 --> 00:57:38,202
Those who stand up and face the music,
and those who run for cover.

909
00:57:38,286 --> 00:57:39,829
Cover's better.

910
00:57:39,912 --> 00:57:42,040
Okay, Sofia, suit him up!

911
00:57:42,123 --> 00:57:43,750
Make him pretty.

912
00:58:00,224 --> 00:58:01,809
Careful.

913
00:58:03,102 --> 00:58:05,063
- Should I ring it?
- Yeah.

914
00:58:13,905 --> 00:58:16,157
- Yes?
- Yes!

915
00:58:16,324 --> 00:58:17,742
Who is this?

916
00:58:18,117 --> 00:58:19,619
It's Randy.

917
00:58:19,786 --> 00:58:21,621
Randy? You new?

918
00:58:22,705 --> 00:58:24,082
I'm your nephew.

919
00:58:24,165 --> 00:58:26,584
Here I am!

920
00:58:26,834 --> 00:58:28,669
Your sister's been hoarding me
long enough.

921
00:58:28,753 --> 00:58:31,714
Thought it's time
to spread the riches around.

922
00:58:32,131 --> 00:58:34,384
- Uncle Frank.
- Gloria!

923
00:58:34,467 --> 00:58:36,427
- Gail.
- Of course.

924
00:58:37,261 --> 00:58:40,056
Say hello to the potluck party
from New York City.

925
00:58:40,139 --> 00:58:43,518
Good old Uncle Frank and this here
with him is Charlie Simms,

926
00:58:43,601 --> 00:58:46,437
star halfback of the Baird football team.

927
00:58:46,521 --> 00:58:50,400
They not only beat Exeter and Groton,
but Aquinas High School too.

928
00:58:51,317 --> 00:58:53,069
Where's your miserable father?

929
00:58:53,152 --> 00:58:55,405
Wait! No, no.
Let's surprise him.

930
00:58:55,488 --> 00:58:59,117
Give that fat heart of his an attack.
Willie!

931
00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:02,578
Ho, Willie!

932
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:17,301
Hello, Frank.

933
00:59:17,844 --> 00:59:20,054
- How you doin'?
- Okay.

934
00:59:20,138 --> 00:59:21,556
Here's my hand.

935
00:59:23,182 --> 00:59:25,435
Charlie, meet W.R. Slade.

936
00:59:25,601 --> 00:59:26,894
Nice to meet you, sir.

937
00:59:26,978 --> 00:59:29,731
The original bulging briefcase man.

938
00:59:29,814 --> 00:59:32,567
Gretchen, I smell those prunes!

939
00:59:32,650 --> 00:59:34,735
- We talkin' turkey Marbella?
- Yes, we are.

940
00:59:38,030 --> 00:59:39,615
Let's have a whiff.
Come on.

941
00:59:39,699 --> 00:59:41,701
You know, I always had a sneaker for you.
Come here.

942
00:59:45,955 --> 00:59:48,249
- Where are you, Garry? I heard you cough.
- Right here.

943
00:59:48,332 --> 00:59:49,959
Who are you again?

944
00:59:50,209 --> 00:59:54,922
I'm here at the Waldorf with...
Is it your brother?

945
00:59:55,006 --> 00:59:57,508
W.R.'s final issue.
How ya doin', son?

946
00:59:57,592 --> 01:00:00,094
Yeah, sure, Frank's my brother.
Who the hell are you?

947
01:00:00,845 --> 01:00:02,847
I'm takin' care of him for the weekend.

948
01:00:02,930 --> 01:00:04,098
Charlie.

949
01:00:06,142 --> 01:00:07,143
Sorry.

950
01:00:07,768 --> 01:00:09,353
Where's the booze?

951
01:00:09,770 --> 01:00:10,938
Flowin' like mud here.

952
01:00:11,022 --> 01:00:14,692
To tell the truth,
the Colonel's not well, I don't think.

953
01:00:15,151 --> 01:00:16,360
Not well?

954
01:00:16,736 --> 01:00:18,738
I think he's a little lonely.

955
01:00:19,322 --> 01:00:21,449
Why didn't you take him
to your family's for dinner?

956
01:00:21,532 --> 01:00:23,034
I heard that!

957
01:00:24,952 --> 01:00:26,370
I heard that.

958
01:00:26,454 --> 01:00:29,624
Pay no attention to him, Charlie.
That's just big-brother talk.

959
01:00:29,707 --> 01:00:32,293
He's been watching out
for me since day one.

960
01:00:32,376 --> 01:00:37,298
Bailed me out of more trouble
than he'd like to remember.

961
01:00:37,381 --> 01:00:39,258
Here, let me take your coat.

962
01:00:40,384 --> 01:00:43,513
I meant to pick up some vino
on my way up, but I blew it.

963
01:00:43,596 --> 01:00:46,140
I'll send you the Rothschild again
for Christmas,

964
01:00:46,224 --> 01:00:48,601
only let's see how Thanksgiving goes.

965
01:00:48,684 --> 01:00:50,102
I'll set two more places.

966
01:00:50,186 --> 01:00:51,562
Here's your drink, Frank.

967
01:00:51,646 --> 01:00:53,439
Oh, thank you, Randy.

968
01:00:53,523 --> 01:00:55,733
Still with Snow Queen Sugar?

969
01:00:56,317 --> 01:00:59,904
Snow Flake.
Why do you always get that wrong?

970
01:01:00,238 --> 01:01:02,281
Because it's not important
for me to get it right.

971
01:01:02,365 --> 01:01:03,991
What are you doing there now?

972
01:01:04,659 --> 01:01:06,577
I'm vice president for marketing.

973
01:01:06,744 --> 01:01:09,413
Congratulations!

974
01:01:09,622 --> 01:01:11,040
Sugar is shit though.

975
01:01:11,123 --> 01:01:14,335
I told General Abrams,
install honey in the commissaries.

976
01:01:14,418 --> 01:01:18,172
If K-50s didn't blow your brains out,
sugar, sure as shit, was gonna.

977
01:01:19,507 --> 01:01:20,508
Why don't we all sit down?

978
01:01:21,717 --> 01:01:25,513
Mitsouki. Rhymes with nookie.
Be careful.

979
01:01:25,596 --> 01:01:28,349
When the wife gets restless,
the wife gets racy.

980
01:01:28,432 --> 01:01:30,017
Well, let's go and eat, shall we?

981
01:01:30,101 --> 01:01:31,519
By all means.

982
01:01:33,104 --> 01:01:34,730
Thank you, Charlie.

983
01:01:34,814 --> 01:01:38,901
Where you wanna sit, Frank?
At the head again?

984
01:01:38,985 --> 01:01:42,780
Any old card table will do.
This is fine.

985
01:01:44,657 --> 01:01:46,033
Where was I?

986
01:01:46,117 --> 01:01:49,370
So, I wake up. It's 4:00 in the morning.
I don't know who I'm with

987
01:01:49,453 --> 01:01:51,789
or why I'm there, or where I am.

988
01:01:52,373 --> 01:01:55,251
What am I gonna do?
I got this Asian flower

989
01:01:55,710 --> 01:01:59,630
on one hand,
all giggly and dewy-like,

990
01:02:00,047 --> 01:02:04,051
and this hard-boiled Navy nurse
outta Omaha, on the other.

991
01:02:04,135 --> 01:02:07,889
We're three across the bed,
not a stitch of clothes on.

992
01:02:08,389 --> 01:02:09,765
It comes to me.

993
01:02:10,808 --> 01:02:15,146
Let east meet west.
We'll build a golden bridge.

994
01:02:17,231 --> 01:02:20,234
I felt like I'd just joined
the corps of engineers!

995
01:02:26,324 --> 01:02:27,992
We all still here?

996
01:02:28,951 --> 01:02:30,953
It's a beautiful story.

997
01:02:33,331 --> 01:02:37,084
Do you always enjoy
shocking people, Uncle Frank?

998
01:02:37,168 --> 01:02:38,252
Honey...

999
01:02:38,336 --> 01:02:40,755
I didn't know you were
so easily shocked, Randy.

1000
01:02:40,838 --> 01:02:43,049
I admire your sensibilities,
I'm touched.

1001
01:02:43,132 --> 01:02:46,093
Dad, remember the time
you persuaded Frank

1002
01:02:46,177 --> 01:02:48,262
to go to the kennel?

1003
01:02:48,346 --> 01:02:49,430
What about it?

1004
01:02:49,513 --> 01:02:51,766
He almost put the seeing eye dog business
outta business.

1005
01:02:51,849 --> 01:02:53,017
Cool it, Randy.

1006
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:54,977
It's over and done with.

1007
01:02:55,394 --> 01:02:57,271
Indeed it is, Garry.

1008
01:02:57,355 --> 01:02:59,440
Indeed it is. So is dinner.

1009
01:02:59,523 --> 01:03:01,108
Charlie, what time you have?

1010
01:03:01,192 --> 01:03:02,693
I think we better be gettin' back.

1011
01:03:02,777 --> 01:03:05,863
You ever given any thought to
a Braille watch, Frank?

1012
01:03:05,946 --> 01:03:06,947
Randy...

1013
01:03:07,031 --> 01:03:10,576
Stevie Wonder wears one,
or do you rank on him too?

1014
01:03:10,660 --> 01:03:11,786
Honey, please.

1015
01:03:11,869 --> 01:03:14,163
It's all right, Gloria.
I enjoy Randy's observations.

1016
01:03:14,246 --> 01:03:16,374
My wife's name is Gail, Frank.

1017
01:03:16,832 --> 01:03:18,334
Can you hear that?
Gail.

1018
01:03:18,417 --> 01:03:20,711
Excuse me. Gail.

1019
01:03:21,462 --> 01:03:24,340
Gail strikes me
as a very beautiful woman,

1020
01:03:24,423 --> 01:03:27,176
but, you know,
there's a little tension in her voice.

1021
01:03:27,259 --> 01:03:30,012
I don't know what it is.
It could be one of two things,

1022
01:03:30,096 --> 01:03:32,723
either Gail is nervous
or unsatisfied.

1023
01:03:34,976 --> 01:03:36,560
What's your point, Uncle Frank?

1024
01:03:36,644 --> 01:03:38,104
You ought to go down on her.

1025
01:03:38,187 --> 01:03:40,439
Cut it out, Frank, will ya?

1026
01:03:40,523 --> 01:03:44,652
You've gotten so wrapped up in sugar,
you forgotten the taste of real honey!

1027
01:03:44,735 --> 01:03:46,195
Frank, for God's sake!

1028
01:03:46,278 --> 01:03:47,363
Hear that voice?

1029
01:03:47,446 --> 01:03:48,990
There's fire under that dress.

1030
01:03:49,073 --> 01:03:51,200
- Will you cut it out?
- Just get the fuck outta here.

1031
01:03:51,283 --> 01:03:53,244
Get in your limousine.

1032
01:03:53,327 --> 01:03:57,373
Go down to the Bowery. Get with
the other fucking drunks, where you belong!

1033
01:03:57,456 --> 01:03:58,541
Wait a minute.

1034
01:03:58,624 --> 01:04:00,418
- What?
- Can you take it easy?

1035
01:04:00,501 --> 01:04:01,585
What for?

1036
01:04:01,669 --> 01:04:05,172
You want me to lay off him, Chucky,
'cause he's blind?

1037
01:04:05,715 --> 01:04:06,674
No, but...

1038
01:04:06,757 --> 01:04:08,759
My friend's name is Charles.

1039
01:04:08,843 --> 01:04:10,761
He doesn't like to be called Chucky.

1040
01:04:10,845 --> 01:04:13,222
This is supposed to be
a family get-together.

1041
01:04:13,305 --> 01:04:14,640
Just a warning.

1042
01:04:14,724 --> 01:04:18,519
Jesus Christ, another sucker who thinks
this shit-heel's a war hero.

1043
01:04:22,231 --> 01:04:24,859
Well, once maybe.

1044
01:04:26,026 --> 01:04:29,280
I suppose he told you about his days
on Lyndon Johnson's staff?

1045
01:04:29,363 --> 01:04:31,949
I was gonna go.
Now I'm not leaving.

1046
01:04:32,658 --> 01:04:34,910
Frank was earmarked for general.

1047
01:04:35,286 --> 01:04:37,079
Earmarked, good word.

1048
01:04:37,371 --> 01:04:39,540
Frank likes to spit in everybody's eye!

1049
01:04:39,623 --> 01:04:40,875
Randy, that's enough.

1050
01:04:40,958 --> 01:04:45,296
So they, what do they call it,
when they give you the shaft in the military?

1051
01:04:45,379 --> 01:04:46,672
Passed over!

1052
01:04:46,756 --> 01:04:49,675
Right, Frank was passed over
for promotion.

1053
01:04:50,468 --> 01:04:51,886
Couple times.

1054
01:04:56,057 --> 01:04:57,183
You wanna know what happened then?

1055
01:04:57,266 --> 01:04:58,726
Will you shut your mouth?

1056
01:04:58,809 --> 01:05:00,144
He blew himself up.

1057
01:05:00,227 --> 01:05:01,645
Stop it, Randy.

1058
01:05:01,729 --> 01:05:04,899
Our Colonel here
had a grenade juggling act

1059
01:05:04,982 --> 01:05:07,401
at Fort Bragg, or wherever
it was they dumped him.

1060
01:05:07,485 --> 01:05:08,486
Fort Benning.

1061
01:05:08,569 --> 01:05:11,405
He was teaching hand-to-hand combat
to second lieutenants...

1062
01:05:11,489 --> 01:05:13,949
Randy, look at me
when you're talking to me now, son.

1063
01:05:14,033 --> 01:05:18,287
I'm lookin', Frank.
His partner in the act was some captain.

1064
01:05:18,370 --> 01:05:19,914
Major Vincent Squires.

1065
01:05:19,997 --> 01:05:21,165
Whoever he was.

1066
01:05:21,248 --> 01:05:23,918
Before going on,
they'd have a lo-cal breakfast,

1067
01:05:24,001 --> 01:05:26,796
a screwdriver for Frank,
bloody mary for his partner.

1068
01:05:26,879 --> 01:05:28,631
No, Vincent drank Sea Breezes.

1069
01:05:28,714 --> 01:05:33,844
The Judge Advocate at Benning said
Colonel Slade had four to his partner's one.

1070
01:05:33,928 --> 01:05:37,556
He's really flying in class.
He gets all excited.

1071
01:05:37,640 --> 01:05:39,975
He starts pulling the pins out.

1072
01:05:42,436 --> 01:05:44,688
One grenade got away from him.

1073
01:05:45,022 --> 01:05:46,190
Boom.

1074
01:05:48,984 --> 01:05:50,694
The one that got away.

1075
01:05:50,778 --> 01:05:53,405
The pin was in, Frank claims.

1076
01:05:55,366 --> 01:05:56,992
In or out,
what difference does it make?

1077
01:05:57,076 --> 01:05:59,954
What kind of fucking lunatic
juggles grenades?

1078
01:06:00,663 --> 01:06:01,914
Vinnie came out okay.

1079
01:06:01,997 --> 01:06:04,208
All Frank lost was his eyesight.

1080
01:06:08,587 --> 01:06:09,713
You wanna know the truth?

1081
01:06:09,797 --> 01:06:11,298
Got a handle on that, do you?

1082
01:06:11,382 --> 01:06:12,800
He was an asshole before.

1083
01:06:15,845 --> 01:06:18,305
Now all he is, is a blind asshole.

1084
01:06:26,021 --> 01:06:28,566
Hey, God's a funny guy.

1085
01:06:30,901 --> 01:06:33,028
God doth have a sense of humor.

1086
01:06:35,823 --> 01:06:39,118
Maybe God thinks
some people don't deserve to see.

1087
01:06:46,167 --> 01:06:48,502
You get the point, Chucky?

1088
01:06:53,465 --> 01:06:55,259
His name is Charles.

1089
01:06:55,926 --> 01:06:58,012
You can say that, can't you?
Charles.

1090
01:06:58,095 --> 01:07:00,514
Know what this is, Randy?
It's a Ranger choke hold.

1091
01:07:00,598 --> 01:07:02,975
- From teaching those lieutenants.
- Colonel, let go.

1092
01:07:03,058 --> 01:07:05,436
Little pressure,
I bust your windpipe.

1093
01:07:05,519 --> 01:07:07,271
- I don't care what he said to me.
- After me.

1094
01:07:07,354 --> 01:07:08,522
Charles.

1095
01:07:08,606 --> 01:07:10,274
Just let go, please!

1096
01:07:30,044 --> 01:07:31,545
Gretchen?

1097
01:07:32,963 --> 01:07:34,840
You outdid yourself.

1098
01:07:36,926 --> 01:07:41,388
If you twist my arm hard enough,
we're talking turkey Marbella next year.

1099
01:07:42,056 --> 01:07:43,557
Who knows?

1100
01:07:50,064 --> 01:07:51,273
Frank?

1101
01:07:52,483 --> 01:07:54,235
Goodbye, Willie.

1102
01:07:58,864 --> 01:08:00,616
I'm no fucking good.

1103
01:08:03,035 --> 01:08:04,954
And I never have been.

1104
01:08:11,001 --> 01:08:13,337
Come on, Charlie, get the coats.

1105
01:08:19,677 --> 01:08:22,096
Colonel.
Watch your step.

1106
01:08:24,765 --> 01:08:26,100
Hold it.

1107
01:08:40,072 --> 01:08:43,784
Nueva York, compadre.
Vamos!

1108
01:09:28,704 --> 01:09:30,331
You got a watch?

1109
01:09:34,126 --> 01:09:35,461
It's 7:20.

1110
01:09:36,587 --> 01:09:39,757
I didn't ask you the time.
I asked if you had a watch.

1111
01:09:40,674 --> 01:09:42,134
Yeah, in the other room.

1112
01:09:42,259 --> 01:09:43,427
Get it.

1113
01:09:47,765 --> 01:09:50,809
Colonel, there's a clock
right next to your bed.

1114
01:09:52,102 --> 01:09:54,104
Does it have a second hand?

1115
01:10:00,444 --> 01:10:02,237
- Yeah.
- Time me!

1116
01:10:30,015 --> 01:10:31,433
How long?

1117
01:10:35,229 --> 01:10:36,980
About 30 seconds.

1118
01:10:37,314 --> 01:10:38,649
I'm rusty.

1119
01:10:39,733 --> 01:10:41,485
Where did you get a gun, Colonel?

1120
01:10:41,568 --> 01:10:44,196
Piece or weapon, Charlie, never gun.

1121
01:10:47,116 --> 01:10:49,284
Where did you get the piece?

1122
01:10:49,743 --> 01:10:52,162
I'm an officer in the US Army.

1123
01:10:52,246 --> 01:10:53,997
This is my sidearm.

1124
01:10:55,165 --> 01:10:56,750
But you're not an officer anymore.

1125
01:10:56,834 --> 01:10:58,669
So I'm retired, so what?

1126
01:10:59,128 --> 01:11:01,922
An officer never relinquishes his .45.

1127
01:11:02,673 --> 01:11:06,301
You better relinquish it to me
or I'm gonna have to call Mrs. Rossi.

1128
01:11:06,385 --> 01:11:07,970
Good idea.

1129
01:11:09,304 --> 01:11:11,098
Then I'm going back to school.

1130
01:11:11,181 --> 01:11:13,725
Even better.
Blue skies, green lights.

1131
01:11:13,809 --> 01:11:15,519
I hope you have a wonderful trip.

1132
01:11:15,602 --> 01:11:18,772
That felt like 25.
Gotta be able to do a .45 in 25.

1133
01:11:18,856 --> 01:11:19,940
Did you time me?

1134
01:11:20,023 --> 01:11:22,192
I did not and I'm calling Albany.

1135
01:11:31,994 --> 01:11:33,412
That was stupid.

1136
01:11:34,913 --> 01:11:36,206
Was it?

1137
01:11:37,958 --> 01:11:39,793
You're stuck with me, Charlie.

1138
01:11:40,794 --> 01:11:42,838
No, I'm not. I'm outta here!

1139
01:11:42,921 --> 01:11:44,506
Where you going, New Hampshire?

1140
01:11:44,590 --> 01:11:47,259
You got no money.
How you gonna do that?

1141
01:11:51,346 --> 01:11:53,682
Karen's number tastes like Albany.

1142
01:11:56,894 --> 01:11:58,437
Fine. I'm leaving.

1143
01:11:58,520 --> 01:12:00,898
Charlie. Charlie!

1144
01:12:13,577 --> 01:12:17,247
All I want from you is another day.

1145
01:12:18,832 --> 01:12:20,167
For what?

1146
01:12:22,753 --> 01:12:25,714
One last tour of the battlefield.

1147
01:12:29,426 --> 01:12:32,095
I can get around a city like New York,

1148
01:12:33,013 --> 01:12:34,806
but I...

1149
01:12:34,890 --> 01:12:37,893
sometimes need a point
in the right direction.

1150
01:12:41,063 --> 01:12:42,856
What do you say, Charles?

1151
01:12:42,940 --> 01:12:45,901
What's one day between friends?

1152
01:12:50,072 --> 01:12:52,783
All right.
Say I stay for another day.

1153
01:12:54,201 --> 01:12:55,786
Will you give me your weapon?

1154
01:12:55,869 --> 01:12:57,079
Oh, Charlie,

1155
01:12:57,162 --> 01:12:59,498
I'm a lieutenant colonel,
United States Army.

1156
01:12:59,581 --> 01:13:02,084
I'm not giving my fucking gun to anyone.

1157
01:13:02,167 --> 01:13:04,544
Now, what are you drinkin'?

1158
01:13:04,628 --> 01:13:07,005
Colonel, this is unacceptable.

1159
01:13:07,089 --> 01:13:10,092
Unacceptable? What are you givin' me
that prep school crap for?

1160
01:13:10,175 --> 01:13:11,552
Unacceptable?

1161
01:13:11,635 --> 01:13:15,264
What have they done,
taken the Oregon out of the boy?

1162
01:13:15,347 --> 01:13:17,724
Put in Harvard Business School?

1163
01:13:18,684 --> 01:13:20,310
Then give me your bullets.

1164
01:13:26,483 --> 01:13:29,695
You do see the sense of it,
Charlie, don't you?

1165
01:13:32,656 --> 01:13:34,992
I can't chew the leather anymore.

1166
01:13:35,993 --> 01:13:40,414
So, why should I share
the tribe's provisions?

1167
01:13:43,083 --> 01:13:44,960
I mean, there's no one

1168
01:13:45,627 --> 01:13:48,338
wants to tear a herring
with me anymore.

1169
01:13:51,049 --> 01:13:52,634
The bullets, Colonel.

1170
01:13:52,801 --> 01:13:54,219
The bullets, Colonel.

1171
01:13:54,428 --> 01:13:57,681
You sound like a guy
in Lives of a Bengal Lancer.

1172
01:14:16,867 --> 01:14:19,036
What do you give a shit for?

1173
01:14:20,370 --> 01:14:21,872
About what?

1174
01:14:21,955 --> 01:14:23,332
About what?

1175
01:14:23,874 --> 01:14:26,668
About whether I blow my brains out or not.

1176
01:14:32,841 --> 01:14:34,593
Because I have a conscience.

1177
01:14:34,676 --> 01:14:36,386
You have a conscience.

1178
01:14:37,596 --> 01:14:38,972
I forgot.

1179
01:14:40,390 --> 01:14:42,351
The Charlie Conscience.

1180
01:14:44,353 --> 01:14:46,813
Do we tell? Do we not tell?

1181
01:14:48,482 --> 01:14:51,234
Do we follow the rich boy's code or not?

1182
01:14:52,235 --> 01:14:54,404
Do we let this blind asshole

1183
01:14:55,280 --> 01:14:57,407
die or not?

1184
01:14:57,949 --> 01:14:59,242
Yeah.

1185
01:14:59,743 --> 01:15:01,495
Conscience, Charlie.

1186
01:15:02,746 --> 01:15:04,373
When were you born, son?

1187
01:15:04,706 --> 01:15:06,750
Around the time of the Round Table?

1188
01:15:08,377 --> 01:15:10,003
Haven't you heard?

1189
01:15:10,462 --> 01:15:13,298
Conscience is dead.

1190
01:15:14,424 --> 01:15:15,926
No, I haven't heard.

1191
01:15:16,009 --> 01:15:19,721
Then take the fucking wax
outta your ears!

1192
01:15:22,766 --> 01:15:24,059
Grow up!

1193
01:15:35,237 --> 01:15:36,947
It's fuck your buddy.

1194
01:15:38,490 --> 01:15:40,117
Cheat on your wife.

1195
01:15:43,453 --> 01:15:45,956
Call your mother on Mother's Day.

1196
01:15:48,125 --> 01:15:49,418
Charlie,

1197
01:15:50,585 --> 01:15:52,462
it's all shit.

1198
01:16:04,015 --> 01:16:05,600
Where you goin'?

1199
01:16:06,476 --> 01:16:08,186
I got piss call.

1200
01:16:09,855 --> 01:16:12,899
I know I said
I need ya for just one day

1201
01:16:12,983 --> 01:16:15,485
but even I can't hold it that long.

1202
01:16:17,988 --> 01:16:19,406
Oh, and Charlie,

1203
01:16:20,991 --> 01:16:23,493
you forgot the one in the chamber.

1204
01:16:31,585 --> 01:16:33,044
There you go, sir.

1205
01:16:33,795 --> 01:16:35,046
Thank you.

1206
01:16:38,091 --> 01:16:40,385
Twenty-six years in the service,

1207
01:16:41,052 --> 01:16:43,346
never let an aide shine my shoes.

1208
01:16:44,014 --> 01:16:46,808
Where you gonna be in 26 years, Charlie?

1209
01:16:47,392 --> 01:16:51,188
Playing golf with your friends
from the Baird School, I bet.

1210
01:16:54,191 --> 01:16:56,526
I don't even like those guys.

1211
01:16:56,610 --> 01:16:59,446
Of course you don't.
They're all assholes.

1212
01:17:00,655 --> 01:17:03,366
Be a pleasure to squeal on 'em,
wouldn't it?

1213
01:17:04,117 --> 01:17:05,786
Yeah, well, I'm not a squealer.

1214
01:17:05,869 --> 01:17:07,329
I'm not a squealer.

1215
01:17:07,412 --> 01:17:09,623
What is this, the Dreyfus case?

1216
01:17:14,127 --> 01:17:16,213
Ooh, mama!

1217
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:18,131
There you go.

1218
01:17:18,215 --> 01:17:19,633
Thank you.

1219
01:17:19,716 --> 01:17:21,384
Thank you.

1220
01:17:22,219 --> 01:17:23,762
Watch your step.

1221
01:17:26,264 --> 01:17:29,351
I'm gettin' that heavy feelin'
again, Charlie.

1222
01:17:32,729 --> 01:17:34,898
There's more to this, isn't there?

1223
01:17:36,233 --> 01:17:37,734
Isn't there?

1224
01:17:41,029 --> 01:17:42,906
I was offered a bribe.

1225
01:17:43,406 --> 01:17:45,116
Now we're cookin'.

1226
01:17:46,409 --> 01:17:48,745
Mr. Trask, the headmaster,

1227
01:17:51,164 --> 01:17:52,999
he promised to get me
into Harvard.

1228
01:17:53,083 --> 01:17:54,584
If you squeal.

1229
01:17:55,252 --> 01:17:56,294
Yeah.

1230
01:17:56,378 --> 01:17:58,171
What a dilemma.

1231
01:17:58,255 --> 01:18:02,092
Should Charlie Simms accept a free ride
into Harvard, or not?

1232
01:18:04,261 --> 01:18:08,181
What do you think your friend George
would do if he were in your shoes?

1233
01:18:08,265 --> 01:18:09,683
He is, practically.

1234
01:18:09,766 --> 01:18:11,142
How?

1235
01:18:11,226 --> 01:18:15,480
It's just that Mr. Trask hasn't promised
to get him into Harvard.

1236
01:18:15,564 --> 01:18:17,315
Mr. Trask doesn't have to.

1237
01:18:17,399 --> 01:18:19,776
George's father's gonna take
care of that.

1238
01:18:21,778 --> 01:18:24,072
Do the deal, Charlie. Take it!

1239
01:18:24,698 --> 01:18:26,116
Go to Harvard.

1240
01:18:27,117 --> 01:18:28,368
I can't do that.

1241
01:18:28,451 --> 01:18:29,619
Why not?

1242
01:18:31,955 --> 01:18:34,791
There are just some things
you can't do.

1243
01:18:35,542 --> 01:18:37,294
Explain 'em to me.

1244
01:18:38,962 --> 01:18:40,213
Louder, please.

1245
01:18:40,297 --> 01:18:41,631
I can't...

1246
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:47,220
You're gonna have a tough time
in this world, Charlie.

1247
01:18:48,305 --> 01:18:51,808
To ease the blow, let me buy you
a drink. Come on.

1248
01:18:53,351 --> 01:18:55,687
Double Jack Daniels on the rocks.

1249
01:18:55,770 --> 01:18:58,982
And bring my young friend here
a Shirley Temple.

1250
01:18:59,649 --> 01:19:01,818
Hold on. Do you have beer?

1251
01:19:02,110 --> 01:19:04,529
Certainly. May I see some ID?

1252
01:19:04,613 --> 01:19:07,824
Are you interested in walkin'
the rest of your life, chappy?

1253
01:19:07,907 --> 01:19:09,075
I'm sorry, sir, but...

1254
01:19:09,159 --> 01:19:12,245
I'm a regular here.
My boy's going on 23.

1255
01:19:12,621 --> 01:19:15,373
Why don't you call up front,
the office?

1256
01:19:15,457 --> 01:19:18,251
Mr. Gilbert, he's a friend of mine.

1257
01:19:20,587 --> 01:19:22,297
Any particular beer?

1258
01:19:22,380 --> 01:19:25,175
Schlitz. No Schlitz?

1259
01:19:25,675 --> 01:19:28,011
Blatz. No Blatz?

1260
01:19:29,137 --> 01:19:30,388
Improvise.

1261
01:19:31,598 --> 01:19:32,974
I'll do my best, sir.

1262
01:19:33,057 --> 01:19:34,017
Thank you, sir.

1263
01:19:34,017 --> 01:19:34,934
Thank you, sir.

1264
01:19:35,727 --> 01:19:38,396
You're human, Charlie.
Beer?

1265
01:19:41,900 --> 01:19:43,902
Who are we drinking with?

1266
01:19:44,069 --> 01:19:47,656
I'm getting a nice soap-and-water
feeling from down there.

1267
01:19:55,747 --> 01:19:57,540
A female.

1268
01:19:57,832 --> 01:19:59,376
Female?

1269
01:20:00,001 --> 01:20:03,672
You callin' her female must mean
you like her or you wouldn't be so casual.

1270
01:20:07,258 --> 01:20:08,551
Is she alone?

1271
01:20:08,635 --> 01:20:10,011
Yeah, she's alone.

1272
01:20:12,097 --> 01:20:13,765
Things are heatin' up.

1273
01:20:14,349 --> 01:20:15,934
Chestnut hair?

1274
01:20:16,226 --> 01:20:18,728
Brown, light brown.

1275
01:20:20,897 --> 01:20:22,315
Twenty-two?

1276
01:20:24,734 --> 01:20:27,070
What am I, a guy at a carnival?

1277
01:20:27,570 --> 01:20:30,490
The day we stop lookin', Charlie,
is the day we die.

1278
01:20:31,491 --> 01:20:32,617
Move.

1279
01:20:32,909 --> 01:20:34,828
- Where?
- You know where, son.

1280
01:20:34,911 --> 01:20:36,746
Don't be coy, Charlie.

1281
01:20:38,873 --> 01:20:41,710
This woman is made for you.
I can feel it.

1282
01:20:42,252 --> 01:20:44,462
Goddamn beautiful, isn't she?

1283
01:20:44,713 --> 01:20:47,590
- She's not bad.
- Bingo! The boy's alive.

1284
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:51,594
Come on, son, perambulate.

1285
01:20:52,595 --> 01:20:54,139
Perambulate.

1286
01:21:03,732 --> 01:21:07,152
Excuse me, señorita,
do you mind if we join you?

1287
01:21:09,112 --> 01:21:11,656
I'm feelin'
you're being neglected.

1288
01:21:12,699 --> 01:21:14,617
I'm expecting somebody.

1289
01:21:16,661 --> 01:21:18,037
Instantly?

1290
01:21:19,414 --> 01:21:21,207
No, but any minute now.

1291
01:21:21,291 --> 01:21:22,542
Any minute?

1292
01:21:22,625 --> 01:21:25,420
Some people live a lifetime
in a minute.

1293
01:21:26,588 --> 01:21:28,673
What are you doin' right now?

1294
01:21:28,965 --> 01:21:31,050
I'm waiting for him.

1295
01:21:31,634 --> 01:21:34,262
Would you mind
if we waited with you,

1296
01:21:35,513 --> 01:21:38,516
just to keep the womanizers
from bothering you?

1297
01:21:42,312 --> 01:21:43,980
No, I don't mind.

1298
01:21:44,314 --> 01:21:45,815
Thank you.

1299
01:21:49,319 --> 01:21:50,487
Charlie.

1300
01:21:54,157 --> 01:21:57,410
You know,
I detect a fragrance in the air.

1301
01:21:57,494 --> 01:21:59,496
Don't tell me what it is.

1302
01:22:00,497 --> 01:22:02,373
Ogilvie Sisters soap.

1303
01:22:04,334 --> 01:22:05,752
That's amazing.

1304
01:22:05,835 --> 01:22:07,921
I'm in the amazing business.

1305
01:22:08,004 --> 01:22:10,006
It is Ogilvie Sisters soap.

1306
01:22:10,673 --> 01:22:12,884
My grandmother gave me
three bars for Christmas.

1307
01:22:12,967 --> 01:22:15,095
I'm crazy about your grandmother.

1308
01:22:15,178 --> 01:22:17,764
I1 think she'd have liked Charlie too.

1309
01:22:18,348 --> 01:22:19,974
Don't pay any attention to him.

1310
01:22:20,058 --> 01:22:21,476
What's your name?

1311
01:22:21,559 --> 01:22:22,769
Donna.

1312
01:22:22,852 --> 01:22:25,939
Donna?
I'm Frank. This here is...

1313
01:22:26,022 --> 01:22:27,273
Charlie.

1314
01:22:27,357 --> 01:22:29,192
Yes. She likes you.

1315
01:22:30,276 --> 01:22:32,195
Charlie's having a difficult weekend.

1316
01:22:32,278 --> 01:22:33,738
He's going through a crisis.

1317
01:22:33,822 --> 01:22:36,616
How does he look like he's holding up?

1318
01:22:36,699 --> 01:22:38,576
He looks fine to me.

1319
01:22:38,660 --> 01:22:40,662
She does like you, Charlie.

1320
01:22:46,668 --> 01:22:48,002
So, Donna,

1321
01:22:50,922 --> 01:22:52,423
do you tango?

1322
01:22:53,049 --> 01:22:55,718
No. I wanted to learn once, but...

1323
01:22:56,261 --> 01:22:57,387
But?

1324
01:22:59,055 --> 01:23:00,807
But Michael didn't want to.

1325
01:23:00,890 --> 01:23:02,100
Michael.

1326
01:23:03,393 --> 01:23:05,478
The one you're waiting for.

1327
01:23:05,562 --> 01:23:08,231
Michael thinks the tango's hysterical.

1328
01:23:08,648 --> 01:23:10,733
I think Michael's hysterical.

1329
01:23:11,526 --> 01:23:13,319
Don't pay any attention to him.

1330
01:23:13,403 --> 01:23:14,529
Did I already say that?

1331
01:23:17,532 --> 01:23:19,325
What a beautiful laugh.

1332
01:23:21,077 --> 01:23:22,704
Thank you, Frank.

1333
01:23:28,418 --> 01:23:31,087
Would you like to learn
to tango, Donna?

1334
01:23:33,923 --> 01:23:35,258
Right now?

1335
01:23:36,676 --> 01:23:40,263
I'm offering you my services,
free of charge.

1336
01:23:40,346 --> 01:23:41,890
What do you say?

1337
01:23:45,351 --> 01:23:47,353
I think I'd be a little afraid.

1338
01:23:48,730 --> 01:23:49,981
Of what?

1339
01:23:50,857 --> 01:23:53,026
Afraid of making a mistake.

1340
01:23:54,569 --> 01:23:58,239
No mistakes in the tango, Donna.
Not like life.

1341
01:23:58,323 --> 01:24:01,117
It's simple.
That's what makes the tango so great.

1342
01:24:01,201 --> 01:24:04,662
If you make a mistake,
get all tangled up, just tango on.

1343
01:24:07,874 --> 01:24:09,626
Why don't you try?

1344
01:24:13,963 --> 01:24:15,590
Will you try it?

1345
01:24:17,550 --> 01:24:19,677
All right. I'll give it a try.

1346
01:24:21,012 --> 01:24:22,639
Hold me down, son.

1347
01:24:29,228 --> 01:24:30,563
Your arm?

1348
01:24:33,566 --> 01:24:34,817
Charlie,

1349
01:24:36,194 --> 01:24:38,738
I'm gonna need
some coordinates here, son.

1350
01:24:38,821 --> 01:24:41,741
The floor's about 20 by 30,

1351
01:24:41,824 --> 01:24:43,993
and you're at the long end.

1352
01:24:44,911 --> 01:24:48,831
There's some tables on the outside
and the band's on the right.

1353
01:27:29,158 --> 01:27:32,954
Oh, Frank,
you are one incredible dancer.

1354
01:27:35,790 --> 01:27:38,084
Wait'll you see Charlie dance.

1355
01:27:38,668 --> 01:27:40,628
He's a liar. I don't dance.

1356
01:27:40,711 --> 01:27:42,171
Isn't he a charmer though?

1357
01:27:42,255 --> 01:27:46,259
Truth is, not only can he dance,
but he'll sing you a hell of a tune.

1358
01:27:46,342 --> 01:27:49,011
He can do bird calls
and imitate Bela Lugosi.

1359
01:27:49,095 --> 01:27:50,138
Hi, honey.

1360
01:27:50,221 --> 01:27:51,305
- Hi.
- Hey.

1361
01:27:51,848 --> 01:27:54,559
Michael, this is Frank
and this is Charlie.

1362
01:27:54,642 --> 01:27:56,769
Hi, Frank, Charlie.
Sorry I'm late.

1363
01:27:56,853 --> 01:27:58,271
Oh, that's okay.

1364
01:27:58,688 --> 01:28:01,232
These two gentlemen entertained me,

1365
01:28:01,315 --> 01:28:02,900
and time flew.

1366
01:28:03,067 --> 01:28:05,862
Your girl is a hell of a tango dancer.

1367
01:28:06,279 --> 01:28:09,282
At last,
you found someone to tango with.

1368
01:28:09,365 --> 01:28:10,741
That's terrific!

1369
01:28:10,825 --> 01:28:12,368
Let me shake your hand.

1370
01:28:12,451 --> 01:28:14,203
No, it was Frank.

1371
01:28:14,287 --> 01:28:16,414
Hell, I'll shake both your hands!

1372
01:28:17,582 --> 01:28:20,543
This looks like the place,
but we gotta go.

1373
01:28:20,626 --> 01:28:24,338
We got a date with Darryl and Carol
in the Village.

1374
01:28:24,422 --> 01:28:26,841
- Do you have a check?
- Michael, please.

1375
01:28:26,924 --> 01:28:28,509
My pleasure.

1376
01:28:28,593 --> 01:28:29,802
Oh, no, no. I got this.

1377
01:28:29,886 --> 01:28:31,762
Michael,
get your hand outta your pocket.

1378
01:28:31,846 --> 01:28:33,556
I'll take it. Really.

1379
01:28:34,182 --> 01:28:35,558
Allow me.

1380
01:28:37,977 --> 01:28:39,437
Why, thank you.

1381
01:28:39,520 --> 01:28:41,022
Bye, guys.

1382
01:28:41,522 --> 01:28:42,565
Bye.

1383
01:28:50,781 --> 01:28:53,743
Darryl and Carol.
Yeah.

1384
01:29:02,543 --> 01:29:04,337
It's apartment 17E, Colonel.

1385
01:29:04,420 --> 01:29:05,963
She's expecting you.

1386
01:29:06,047 --> 01:29:09,884
Don't worry about a thing.
She's the crème de la crème.

1387
01:29:09,967 --> 01:29:12,470
My buddy took the Vice Chancellor
of Germany to her.

1388
01:29:12,553 --> 01:29:14,847
Now he wants to immigrate
to this country.

1389
01:29:15,097 --> 01:29:17,225
You did good, hombre.

1390
01:29:19,435 --> 01:29:21,270
My hair, how is it?

1391
01:29:22,396 --> 01:29:23,814
It's perfect.

1392
01:29:27,235 --> 01:29:29,195
I got the red foulard okay,
didn't I?

1393
01:29:29,779 --> 01:29:31,364
Yeah, real dark red.

1394
01:29:31,447 --> 01:29:34,492
Burgundy, Charlie.
Burgundy. They love it.

1395
01:29:36,953 --> 01:29:38,162
Bay rum.

1396
01:29:40,456 --> 01:29:41,916
Windsor knot.

1397
01:29:44,794 --> 01:29:46,921
That's my heart I'm feelin'.

1398
01:29:56,847 --> 01:29:58,057
I'm off.

1399
01:30:16,492 --> 01:30:17,910
Can you get long distance on this?

1400
01:30:17,994 --> 01:30:19,870
And how. Be my guest.

1401
01:30:30,923 --> 01:30:32,258
Sugarbush Lodge.

1402
01:30:32,341 --> 01:30:33,843
Hi. George Willis, please?

1403
01:30:33,926 --> 01:30:35,720
One moment, please.

1404
01:30:37,388 --> 01:30:39,390
- Hello?
- Harry?

1405
01:30:39,473 --> 01:30:41,601
Chas, how are you?

1406
01:30:41,684 --> 01:30:44,895
You just caught us. We're about to shoot
George over to the airport.

1407
01:30:44,979 --> 01:30:47,356
Why is George going to the airport?

1408
01:30:47,857 --> 01:30:51,068
Hold on.
Maybe you should talk to the man himself.

1409
01:30:52,361 --> 01:30:53,404
Chas.

1410
01:30:53,487 --> 01:30:54,530
Yeah. Hi, George.

1411
01:30:54,613 --> 01:30:55,906
You just caught me.

1412
01:30:55,990 --> 01:30:58,618
That's what Harry said.
Where you goin'?

1413
01:30:58,701 --> 01:30:59,910
Home.

1414
01:30:59,994 --> 01:31:01,162
To Boston?

1415
01:31:01,245 --> 01:31:04,040
Catching the puddle-jumper.
Keep your fingers crossed.

1416
01:31:04,123 --> 01:31:06,375
What are you going home for?

1417
01:31:09,253 --> 01:31:13,215
I was thinking. This asshole, Trask?
He's making no sense at all.

1418
01:31:14,550 --> 01:31:18,137
Somebody's gotta talk to him.
My father was class of '59.

1419
01:31:18,220 --> 01:31:22,099
Your father? I thought we were gonna
keep our parents outta this.

1420
01:31:22,391 --> 01:31:25,144
This guy Trask is out of control, Chas.

1421
01:31:25,728 --> 01:31:28,731
Out of control!
Somebody's gotta talk to him.

1422
01:31:28,814 --> 01:31:31,609
My father's a major fundraiser,
you know.

1423
01:31:31,734 --> 01:31:32,818
No, I didn't.

1424
01:31:32,902 --> 01:31:33,986
Right.

1425
01:31:34,070 --> 01:31:36,405
Relax.
He'll get us off the hook.

1426
01:31:36,614 --> 01:31:38,324
I gotta go.
Everything all right?

1427
01:31:38,407 --> 01:31:39,575
Sure.

1428
01:31:39,784 --> 01:31:41,869
I'll see you Monday.
Goodbye.

1429
01:31:42,161 --> 01:31:43,245
Bye.

1430
01:32:07,978 --> 01:32:10,022
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

1431
01:32:22,410 --> 01:32:23,411
Hiya, Charlie.

1432
01:32:25,746 --> 01:32:27,248
Watch the door.

1433
01:32:45,850 --> 01:32:47,977
What a beautiful woman.

1434
01:33:01,991 --> 01:33:03,826
Hello, there.

1435
01:33:03,909 --> 01:33:05,744
Do you see what I see?

1436
01:33:05,828 --> 01:33:08,581
Yeah.
Either there's something wrong,

1437
01:33:08,664 --> 01:33:11,000
or we got the world's worst hangover.

1438
01:33:11,083 --> 01:33:13,085
Won't you come in?

1439
01:33:13,169 --> 01:33:15,421
We hear you got a picture
of the bank robbery.

1440
01:33:33,606 --> 01:33:34,899
Colonel?

1441
01:33:49,288 --> 01:33:51,207
Colonel, you all right?

1442
01:33:52,917 --> 01:33:54,376
What is it?

1443
01:33:57,755 --> 01:33:59,381
It's after noon.

1444
01:34:00,007 --> 01:34:02,301
You've been sleeping all morning.

1445
01:34:03,385 --> 01:34:04,762
So what?

1446
01:34:07,264 --> 01:34:09,099
I don't know. I thought...

1447
01:34:14,021 --> 01:34:16,023
I talked to George last night.

1448
01:34:18,359 --> 01:34:22,363
His father's a big-deal alumnus at school.
He's got a lot of pull.

1449
01:34:23,989 --> 01:34:25,324
Really?

1450
01:34:27,785 --> 01:34:31,247
Yeah, he's gonna talk
to the headmaster.

1451
01:34:33,082 --> 01:34:36,210
George thinks he might be able
to get us off the hook.

1452
01:34:36,293 --> 01:34:38,212
Get us off the hook.

1453
01:34:38,963 --> 01:34:40,965
Yeah, that's what he said.

1454
01:34:42,758 --> 01:34:44,635
Watch the us part.

1455
01:34:47,763 --> 01:34:51,016
Colonel, don't you wanna get up
and do something?

1456
01:34:55,145 --> 01:34:56,397
Colonel?

1457
01:34:57,314 --> 01:34:59,358
Oh, Charlie, what do you want?

1458
01:34:59,942 --> 01:35:02,361
I don't know,

1459
01:35:02,444 --> 01:35:04,613
but you're making me nervous.

1460
01:35:07,491 --> 01:35:09,743
My wallet is on the dresser.

1461
01:35:11,412 --> 01:35:13,455
Take out your plane ticket

1462
01:35:14,331 --> 01:35:18,586
and $400 mustering-out pay,
plus

1463
01:35:20,170 --> 01:35:23,465
airport-to-school taxi.

1464
01:35:26,468 --> 01:35:29,138
Colonel, it's no rush.
I mean, I can...

1465
01:35:30,180 --> 01:35:31,682
I could stay for a while.

1466
01:35:31,765 --> 01:35:34,059
Charlie, you already gave me a day.

1467
01:35:35,603 --> 01:35:38,647
And for that day,
I am eternally grateful.

1468
01:35:41,317 --> 01:35:45,195
But right now I have other plans.

1469
01:35:46,822 --> 01:35:49,074
What other plans do you have?

1470
01:35:51,118 --> 01:35:52,620
To die, son.

1471
01:35:54,622 --> 01:35:56,332
Colonel, you're...

1472
01:35:56,999 --> 01:36:00,002
Come on, Colonel,
you're not gonna die today.

1473
01:36:00,544 --> 01:36:02,796
Charlie, give me your hand.

1474
01:36:07,468 --> 01:36:09,345
You go now, boy. Okay?

1475
01:36:11,931 --> 01:36:13,766
You go. Just...

1476
01:36:17,519 --> 01:36:19,647
Just leave me sleep here.

1477
01:36:21,148 --> 01:36:24,068
Look...
Can we start over, please?

1478
01:36:25,361 --> 01:36:27,738
What do you feel
like doin' today, huh?

1479
01:36:28,530 --> 01:36:30,950
Look at this.
The sun is shining!

1480
01:36:31,033 --> 01:36:33,202
It's a beautiful day.
Let's...

1481
01:36:37,373 --> 01:36:40,459
Colonel, I know
you don't want to be a party poop,

1482
01:36:40,542 --> 01:36:42,336
so let's go out and do something.

1483
01:36:42,419 --> 01:36:44,213
Let's go for a ride.

1484
01:36:49,718 --> 01:36:51,220
Yeah, a ride.

1485
01:36:53,597 --> 01:36:55,391
A ride?

1486
01:36:56,725 --> 01:36:58,978
Yeah, Colonel Slade,
what do you say?

1487
01:36:59,061 --> 01:37:00,896
Let's go for a ride, huh?

1488
01:37:08,821 --> 01:37:10,531
What kind of ride?

1489
01:37:12,658 --> 01:37:15,494
Yeah, this is a valid
Oregon driver's license,

1490
01:37:15,577 --> 01:37:19,289
and we let appropriate customers
test-drive the Testarossa.

1491
01:37:19,373 --> 01:37:23,252
But you're 17, with a blind companion.
That we don't do.

1492
01:37:23,335 --> 01:37:25,504
This is a $190,000 piece of machinery.

1493
01:37:25,587 --> 01:37:28,006
I'm not letting it out this door.

1494
01:37:28,090 --> 01:37:29,550
How about this one over here?

1495
01:37:29,633 --> 01:37:32,177
That's a Cabriolet T.
The same deal.

1496
01:37:32,261 --> 01:37:36,640
You think I'll let an unaccompanied kid
get in a $110,000 car?

1497
01:37:36,724 --> 01:37:38,934
He will not be unaccompanied.

1498
01:37:39,810 --> 01:37:42,438
I'll be with him.
I'm his father.

1499
01:37:43,230 --> 01:37:44,732
You're his father?

1500
01:37:44,815 --> 01:37:46,025
Yes.

1501
01:37:46,442 --> 01:37:49,445
I have an idea. Why don't I take
your father for a test drive?

1502
01:37:49,528 --> 01:37:51,405
What's your quota, Freddie?

1503
01:37:51,488 --> 01:37:53,407
Don't worry about my quota.
I do well.

1504
01:37:53,490 --> 01:37:55,451
How many Ferraris
you sold this month?

1505
01:37:55,534 --> 01:37:57,327
That's not relevant to
this discussion.

1506
01:37:57,411 --> 01:37:59,538
Freddie, the '80s are over.

1507
01:38:00,372 --> 01:38:03,125
Are you tryin' to tell me
these things are walkin' outta the store?

1508
01:38:03,208 --> 01:38:07,337
This is a Ferrari, sir, the finest machinery
made in the automobile industry.

1509
01:38:07,421 --> 01:38:10,674
If you like it that much, why don't you
sleep with it? Why are you sellin' it?

1510
01:38:10,758 --> 01:38:12,176
I'd love to accommodate you...

1511
01:38:12,259 --> 01:38:15,262
If this car performs
the way I expect it to,

1512
01:38:15,345 --> 01:38:18,974
you will get a check of $101,000
and change,

1513
01:38:19,057 --> 01:38:21,059
when you come in here
tomorrow morning.

1514
01:38:21,143 --> 01:38:25,063
It's $109,000, plus $950, plus tax.

1515
01:38:25,147 --> 01:38:27,900
Freddie, for you

1516
01:38:27,983 --> 01:38:30,652
107 all in,

1517
01:38:30,736 --> 01:38:34,323
plus a case of champagne
to go with your leftover turkey.

1518
01:38:35,574 --> 01:38:38,285
What do you say?
Don't worry about the boy.

1519
01:38:38,368 --> 01:38:42,039
He drives so smooth,
you can boil an egg on the engine.

1520
01:38:42,122 --> 01:38:45,334
When we bring the car back,
I'll peel the egg for ya.

1521
01:38:46,335 --> 01:38:49,963
Listen, you made me laugh,
but I can't let the car go out.

1522
01:38:51,924 --> 01:38:53,634
Want a deposit?

1523
01:38:53,717 --> 01:38:56,178
This is not an installment item, sir.

1524
01:38:59,515 --> 01:39:03,143
Freddie, you're no spring chicken.

1525
01:39:05,312 --> 01:39:08,273
You know what they call me
at the home office?

1526
01:39:08,357 --> 01:39:09,441
The Grey Ghost.

1527
01:39:09,525 --> 01:39:11,819
You know why they still keep me around?

1528
01:39:11,902 --> 01:39:15,280
There's no kid here
that can move a Ferrari like I can.

1529
01:39:15,364 --> 01:39:17,991
I'm known from coast to coast
like butter and toast.

1530
01:39:18,075 --> 01:39:20,452
Ask anybody about Freddie Bisco.

1531
01:39:20,536 --> 01:39:21,954
When I get a Ferrari...

1532
01:39:22,037 --> 01:39:23,622
Out the door!

1533
01:39:25,123 --> 01:39:26,792
You just made me laugh, Freddie.

1534
01:39:26,875 --> 01:39:28,043
Yeah?

1535
01:39:28,794 --> 01:39:30,045
2,000.

1536
01:39:31,380 --> 01:39:34,258
Unless you take it,
you're gonna make me cry.

1537
01:39:37,553 --> 01:39:39,388
I'm a grey ghost too.

1538
01:39:50,816 --> 01:39:53,902
See?
This is fun, isn't it?

1539
01:40:08,458 --> 01:40:11,879
Drop her into neutral.
Slide her into second.

1540
01:40:12,421 --> 01:40:13,839
Pop the clutch.

1541
01:40:51,460 --> 01:40:54,212
Straight.
Hold it right like that.

1542
01:40:54,296 --> 01:40:56,423
Feel it? That's straight.

1543
01:40:56,506 --> 01:40:58,759
It's a straight street,
so keep it straight.

1544
01:41:01,553 --> 01:41:02,930
Keep it straight.

1545
01:41:03,013 --> 01:41:04,598
No fun just to keep it straight.

1546
01:41:04,681 --> 01:41:07,643
You've got to move a little bit,
feel the road.

1547
01:41:08,018 --> 01:41:11,021
Please? Just like this.
All right? There you go.

1548
01:41:11,563 --> 01:41:13,482
Take it nice and easy.

1549
01:41:14,316 --> 01:41:15,901
Do you like this?

1550
01:41:19,655 --> 01:41:22,699
Slow it down a little, Colonel.
You're goin' a little fast.

1551
01:41:23,659 --> 01:41:25,953
Colonel, slow it down.

1552
01:41:26,787 --> 01:41:28,830
Something's happened to my foot!

1553
01:41:30,582 --> 01:41:31,750
Slow it down, please.

1554
01:41:31,833 --> 01:41:34,503
Hold on.
I think I've got another gear.

1555
01:41:35,379 --> 01:41:36,922
Colonel Slade?

1556
01:41:40,676 --> 01:41:41,927
Watch out!

1557
01:41:45,847 --> 01:41:47,099
You'll get us killed!

1558
01:41:47,182 --> 01:41:49,518
Don't blame me, Charlie,
I can't see!

1559
01:41:52,187 --> 01:41:53,480
Colonel, slow it down!

1560
01:42:04,157 --> 01:42:05,367
Oh, Jesus!

1561
01:42:05,867 --> 01:42:08,620
Now let's see how this baby corners.

1562
01:42:08,704 --> 01:42:09,663
Corners?

1563
01:42:09,746 --> 01:42:11,206
Yeah. Say when.

1564
01:42:11,873 --> 01:42:13,041
Say when what?

1565
01:42:13,125 --> 01:42:14,334
Say when to turn.

1566
01:42:14,418 --> 01:42:16,295
Colonel, you can't turn the car.

1567
01:42:16,378 --> 01:42:18,046
Where's the turn, Charlie?

1568
01:42:18,588 --> 01:42:21,967
3 o'clock? 2 o'clock?
Right oblique? Right face?

1569
01:42:22,050 --> 01:42:23,760
Come on! Talk to me!

1570
01:42:24,803 --> 01:42:26,346
It's left, I guess.

1571
01:42:26,430 --> 01:42:29,099
Left. I knew it. Okay. Now?

1572
01:42:30,726 --> 01:42:32,853
No, no! Not now! Not now!

1573
01:42:34,104 --> 01:42:35,272
Now?

1574
01:42:35,564 --> 01:42:36,815
Colonel, please!

1575
01:42:36,898 --> 01:42:39,109
I'm gonna do it anyway, all right?

1576
01:42:39,192 --> 01:42:41,194
Whether you say so or not,
here we go!

1577
01:42:41,278 --> 01:42:43,655
Okay! Wait, wait, wait!
Just wait!

1578
01:42:43,739 --> 01:42:45,907
Here I go.

1579
01:42:45,991 --> 01:42:47,826
Wait... Now!

1580
01:42:54,416 --> 01:42:57,252
I did it! Oh, Charlie!

1581
01:42:58,879 --> 01:43:01,715
You're ridin'
with one very happy man!

1582
01:43:03,425 --> 01:43:04,718
Turn again!

1583
01:43:04,801 --> 01:43:06,053
Be specific, son.

1584
01:43:06,762 --> 01:43:07,804
Left now!

1585
01:43:07,888 --> 01:43:08,972
Okay.

1586
01:43:14,102 --> 01:43:16,772
I love this! I love it!

1587
01:43:18,315 --> 01:43:20,192
Shall we take it to the max?

1588
01:43:20,442 --> 01:43:21,943
Let me out.

1589
01:43:24,321 --> 01:43:26,114
Shit! The yellow flag.

1590
01:43:27,074 --> 01:43:30,077
I haven't even opened her up yet.
Which way's the curb?

1591
01:43:30,160 --> 01:43:32,621
Pull over. Slowdown! Slowdown.

1592
01:43:32,704 --> 01:43:33,830
I'm doin' it.

1593
01:43:33,914 --> 01:43:35,832
Pull over to the curb here.
Slow down.

1594
01:43:35,916 --> 01:43:37,042
Yep. Got it.

1595
01:43:49,888 --> 01:43:52,974
Haven't had a ticket in years.

1596
01:43:56,311 --> 01:43:58,021
I'll do the talking.

1597
01:44:03,693 --> 01:44:05,695
License and registration.

1598
01:44:17,916 --> 01:44:19,918
Are you test-driving this baby?

1599
01:44:20,001 --> 01:44:21,878
Don't she purr though?

1600
01:44:22,462 --> 01:44:24,214
At 70 miles an hour?

1601
01:44:24,297 --> 01:44:26,675
You should hear her at 125.

1602
01:44:28,552 --> 01:44:30,387
Where's your license?

1603
01:44:31,972 --> 01:44:33,557
At the dealer's.

1604
01:44:33,640 --> 01:44:36,309
They give it back
when you return the car.

1605
01:44:37,310 --> 01:44:38,728
You got ID?

1606
01:44:38,812 --> 01:44:40,355
You bet.

1607
01:44:41,606 --> 01:44:42,983
Indeed.

1608
01:44:46,903 --> 01:44:48,864
Lieutenant Colonel Slade.

1609
01:44:49,489 --> 01:44:51,158
And you, soldier?

1610
01:44:51,950 --> 01:44:54,494
The name is Police Officer Gore.

1611
01:44:56,329 --> 01:44:58,331
Doin' a hell of a job, Gore.

1612
01:44:58,415 --> 01:45:00,458
And so are you, Colonel.

1613
01:45:01,585 --> 01:45:03,086
Who's the kid?

1614
01:45:04,171 --> 01:45:05,964
My boy Charlie.

1615
01:45:06,047 --> 01:45:08,008
He kept tellin' me
to let her out.

1616
01:45:08,091 --> 01:45:10,343
What was I gonna do,
disappoint him?

1617
01:45:10,886 --> 01:45:12,053
Yes.

1618
01:45:15,932 --> 01:45:17,934
Tell you what I'm gonna do, Colonel.

1619
01:45:18,018 --> 01:45:20,812
I'm gonna let you go,
on one condition.

1620
01:45:20,896 --> 01:45:22,355
What's that?

1621
01:45:22,647 --> 01:45:25,400
That you take this rig
straight back to the dealer.

1622
01:45:27,694 --> 01:45:29,029
You got it.

1623
01:45:29,112 --> 01:45:30,405
Shut up.

1624
01:45:31,198 --> 01:45:32,574
You want this?

1625
01:45:32,908 --> 01:45:34,242
Sure.

1626
01:45:35,243 --> 01:45:36,786
Gore?

1627
01:45:37,245 --> 01:45:39,998
Your face and your voice are familiar.

1628
01:45:40,081 --> 01:45:42,834
You ever been in
the officer's club at Da Nang?

1629
01:45:43,752 --> 01:45:45,003
No.

1630
01:45:45,086 --> 01:45:46,755
Never in the Army?

1631
01:45:47,923 --> 01:45:49,549
No. Coast Guard.

1632
01:45:50,175 --> 01:45:51,718
Good Lord.

1633
01:45:57,098 --> 01:45:59,434
Your dad is looking good, Charlie.

1634
01:45:59,517 --> 01:46:03,063
He's got a heavy foot though.
Tell him to take it light, all right?

1635
01:46:04,439 --> 01:46:06,274
- I hear ya!
- All right.

1636
01:46:06,358 --> 01:46:07,567
Thanks.

1637
01:46:20,539 --> 01:46:23,625
Get out of the car,
because you are not driving anymore.

1638
01:46:23,708 --> 01:46:26,545
Just keeping this baby warm,
that's all.

1639
01:46:28,380 --> 01:46:30,465
I'm not drivin' anymore.

1640
01:46:34,928 --> 01:46:36,137
Yes.

1641
01:46:41,476 --> 01:46:43,311
- Take my arm.
- I'm okay.

1642
01:46:43,770 --> 01:46:46,147
Colonel, it's really bumpy here.

1643
01:47:00,161 --> 01:47:01,746
You all right?

1644
01:47:05,166 --> 01:47:06,209
Yeah.

1645
01:47:14,384 --> 01:47:16,344
Red light. Hold it.

1646
01:47:22,767 --> 01:47:24,352
Taking too long.

1647
01:47:27,981 --> 01:47:30,942
Shit! Colonel! Colonel!

1648
01:47:41,494 --> 01:47:42,746
Colonel!

1649
01:47:43,413 --> 01:47:45,206
Shit! You all right?

1650
01:47:46,249 --> 01:47:48,335
What the hell are you doing?

1651
01:47:48,418 --> 01:47:49,544
Take the cane.

1652
01:47:49,628 --> 01:47:50,628
I gotta take a piss.

1653
01:47:50,712 --> 01:47:51,880
Take the cane.

1654
01:47:51,963 --> 01:47:53,298
Happens to the best of us.

1655
01:47:53,381 --> 01:47:55,342
We're on Park Avenue.
You can't.

1656
01:47:55,425 --> 01:47:56,926
Perfect place.

1657
01:47:57,427 --> 01:47:59,095
You'll get arrested.

1658
01:47:59,179 --> 01:48:01,014
Never been housebroken.

1659
01:48:01,097 --> 01:48:02,641
Colonel! Shit!

1660
01:48:03,725 --> 01:48:06,311
What's the matter with you, Colonel?

1661
01:48:12,525 --> 01:48:15,945
What are you doing?
Stand up.

1662
01:48:17,405 --> 01:48:18,615
Come on.

1663
01:48:18,698 --> 01:48:21,368
I'm tired, Charlie. I'm tired.

1664
01:48:23,453 --> 01:48:25,121
Give me your arm.

1665
01:48:25,747 --> 01:48:27,415
Here's your cane.

1666
01:48:28,750 --> 01:48:30,752
Take me back to the hotel, son.

1667
01:48:36,966 --> 01:48:38,802
Home at last.

1668
01:49:00,115 --> 01:49:01,908
You all right now?

1669
01:49:03,785 --> 01:49:04,911
Yeah.

1670
01:49:08,873 --> 01:49:10,959
Do you want to use the bathroom?

1671
01:49:11,042 --> 01:49:12,127
No.

1672
01:49:21,302 --> 01:49:22,679
Can I get you something?

1673
01:49:22,762 --> 01:49:23,888
No.

1674
01:49:28,059 --> 01:49:29,144
You sure you're all right?

1675
01:49:29,227 --> 01:49:30,895
I'm fine, Charlie.

1676
01:49:49,789 --> 01:49:52,167
Do you mind if I use the phone?

1677
01:49:52,250 --> 01:49:53,501
Go ahead.

1678
01:50:12,687 --> 01:50:13,938
Hello?

1679
01:50:14,022 --> 01:50:15,815
Hi, is George there, please?

1680
01:50:15,899 --> 01:50:17,567
Senior or Junior?

1681
01:50:19,068 --> 01:50:20,361
Junior.

1682
01:50:20,445 --> 01:50:21,946
Who's this?

1683
01:50:22,030 --> 01:50:23,490
A friend of his from school.

1684
01:50:23,573 --> 01:50:27,702
Sorry, but George isn't going to be talking
to any friends from school right now.

1685
01:50:31,331 --> 01:50:32,540
Goodbye.

1686
01:50:49,974 --> 01:50:52,352
Colonel, are you looking at me?

1687
01:50:55,063 --> 01:50:56,814
I'm blind, Charlie.

1688
01:51:03,112 --> 01:51:04,948
I'm gonna take a nap.

1689
01:51:07,742 --> 01:51:09,577
Too much fresh air.

1690
01:51:11,412 --> 01:51:13,581
It's probably a good idea.

1691
01:51:14,123 --> 01:51:16,543
Want me to help you to your room?

1692
01:51:17,126 --> 01:51:18,211
No.

1693
01:51:19,546 --> 01:51:20,755
Couch.

1694
01:51:21,923 --> 01:51:23,800
I like this couch here.

1695
01:51:27,095 --> 01:51:29,430
You sure you're all right, Colonel?

1696
01:51:29,514 --> 01:51:31,140
I got a headache.

1697
01:51:37,438 --> 01:51:40,650
Why don't you go downstairs,
get me some aspirin?

1698
01:51:40,733 --> 01:51:43,695
- Some aspirin.
- Yeah. Also...

1699
01:51:46,531 --> 01:51:48,283
I feel like a cigar.

1700
01:51:49,826 --> 01:51:53,121
Get me a couple of
Montecristos Number One.

1701
01:51:54,289 --> 01:51:55,707
Montecristos Number One.

1702
01:51:55,790 --> 01:51:56,875
Yeah.

1703
01:51:56,958 --> 01:51:59,752
You won't be able to get 'em
at the newsstand downstairs.

1704
01:51:59,836 --> 01:52:01,880
So why don't you go over to

1705
01:52:02,630 --> 01:52:05,174
50th and Fifth, Dunhill's.

1706
01:52:05,967 --> 01:52:08,761
Fella named Arnold there,
in the humidor.

1707
01:52:09,679 --> 01:52:12,307
Tell him they're for me.

1708
01:52:13,683 --> 01:52:14,892
He'll know.

1709
01:53:03,858 --> 01:53:05,985
You're back too fast.

1710
01:53:08,780 --> 01:53:11,115
You didn't get my cigars, did you?

1711
01:53:16,454 --> 01:53:18,373
Get out of here, Charlie.

1712
01:53:22,710 --> 01:53:24,587
I thought we had a deal.

1713
01:53:25,380 --> 01:53:29,342
I welched. I'm a welcher.
Didn't I tell you?

1714
01:53:30,885 --> 01:53:34,347
No, what you told me
was that you gave me all the bullets.

1715
01:53:34,722 --> 01:53:35,973
I lied.

1716
01:53:37,892 --> 01:53:39,560
You could have fooled me.

1717
01:53:39,644 --> 01:53:41,020
And I did.

1718
01:53:43,898 --> 01:53:47,235
How you ever gonna survive
in this world without me?

1719
01:53:52,115 --> 01:53:55,159
Why don't you just give me
the gun, all right?

1720
01:54:04,085 --> 01:54:06,295
What are you doing?

1721
01:54:07,630 --> 01:54:09,716
I'm gonna shoot you too.

1722
01:54:12,802 --> 01:54:14,762
Your life's finished anyway.

1723
01:54:16,014 --> 01:54:18,850
Your friend George
is going to sing like a canary.

1724
01:54:18,933 --> 01:54:20,643
And so are you.

1725
01:54:20,727 --> 01:54:23,271
And once you've sung,
Charlie, my boy,

1726
01:54:23,563 --> 01:54:27,692
you're gonna take your place
on that long, gray line

1727
01:54:27,775 --> 01:54:29,610
of American manhood.

1728
01:54:31,237 --> 01:54:33,448
And you will be through.

1729
01:54:35,116 --> 01:54:37,035
I'd like to disagree with you, Colonel.

1730
01:54:37,118 --> 01:54:39,370
You're in no position
to disagree with me, boy.

1731
01:54:39,454 --> 01:54:42,707
I got a loaded .45 here.
You got pimples.

1732
01:54:43,708 --> 01:54:45,460
I'm gonna kill ya, Charlie,

1733
01:54:46,169 --> 01:54:49,547
because I can't bear
the thought of you sellin' out!

1734
01:54:51,883 --> 01:54:54,385
Put the gun down, all right, Colonel?

1735
01:54:54,469 --> 01:54:57,597
What?
You givin' me an ultimatum?

1736
01:54:57,972 --> 01:54:59,307
No, I'm...

1737
01:55:00,767 --> 01:55:02,685
I give the ultimatums!

1738
01:55:04,479 --> 01:55:05,813
I'm sorry.

1739
01:55:07,732 --> 01:55:09,567
All right? I'm sorry.

1740
01:55:12,820 --> 01:55:14,405
It's all right,

1741
01:55:15,656 --> 01:55:17,116
Charlie.

1742
01:55:22,080 --> 01:55:23,998
You break my heart, son.

1743
01:55:25,625 --> 01:55:27,460
All my life I stood up

1744
01:55:28,461 --> 01:55:30,463
to everyone and everything,

1745
01:55:31,672 --> 01:55:35,551
because it made me feel important.

1746
01:55:38,012 --> 01:55:40,431
You do it 'cause you mean it.

1747
01:55:43,601 --> 01:55:45,353
You got integrity, Charlie.

1748
01:55:49,565 --> 01:55:52,902
I don't know whether
to shoot you or adopt you.

1749
01:55:55,738 --> 01:55:58,116
Not much of a choice, is it, sir?

1750
01:55:58,199 --> 01:56:00,034
Don't get cute now.

1751
01:56:00,785 --> 01:56:02,703
Could you please put the gun away?

1752
01:56:02,787 --> 01:56:04,580
I asked you a question.

1753
01:56:05,081 --> 01:56:08,000
Do you want me to adopt you,
or don't you?

1754
01:56:09,168 --> 01:56:10,795
Please? I mean...

1755
01:56:12,380 --> 01:56:14,715
You're just in a slump right now.

1756
01:56:14,924 --> 01:56:16,050
Slump?

1757
01:56:18,803 --> 01:56:20,555
No slump, Charlie.

1758
01:56:22,890 --> 01:56:24,183
I'm bad.

1759
01:56:27,061 --> 01:56:28,980
I'm not bad. No.

1760
01:56:31,649 --> 01:56:33,150
I'm rotten.

1761
01:56:36,487 --> 01:56:38,072
You're not bad.

1762
01:56:41,409 --> 01:56:43,202
You're just in pain.

1763
01:56:48,875 --> 01:56:51,127
What do you know about pain?

1764
01:56:54,922 --> 01:56:59,218
You little snail darter
from the Pacific Northwest.

1765
01:57:00,386 --> 01:57:02,388
Fuck you know about pain?

1766
01:57:06,100 --> 01:57:08,352
Let me have the gun, Colonel.

1767
01:57:08,769 --> 01:57:10,938
No time to grow a dick, son.

1768
01:57:12,148 --> 01:57:14,859
Just give me the gun, all right, Colonel?

1769
01:57:16,777 --> 01:57:18,905
I'm talkin' a parade ground.

1770
01:57:19,113 --> 01:57:20,406
Ten-hut!

1771
01:57:23,284 --> 01:57:26,495
Soldier, that was a direct order.

1772
01:57:28,372 --> 01:57:29,999
Give me the gun.

1773
01:57:33,794 --> 01:57:36,464
You can stay or you can leave.

1774
01:57:37,632 --> 01:57:39,383
You understand?

1775
01:57:39,467 --> 01:57:42,470
Either way, I'm gonna do this thing.

1776
01:57:45,097 --> 01:57:48,809
Now why don't you leave
and spare yourself?

1777
01:57:51,646 --> 01:57:53,648
I want your gun, Colonel.

1778
01:58:02,615 --> 01:58:04,825
I'm gonna give myself a count.

1779
01:58:10,164 --> 01:58:12,833
You need a count for balance.

1780
01:58:16,128 --> 01:58:17,505
Five...

1781
01:58:18,673 --> 01:58:19,674
Four...

1782
01:58:21,467 --> 01:58:22,885
Three...

1783
01:58:25,179 --> 01:58:26,389
Two...

1784
01:58:29,016 --> 01:58:30,184
One...

1785
01:58:32,311 --> 01:58:33,437
Fuck it.

1786
01:58:41,153 --> 01:58:42,863
Give me! Fuck!

1787
01:58:46,200 --> 01:58:47,285
Get out of here!

1788
01:58:47,368 --> 01:58:48,661
I'm stayin' right here!

1789
01:58:48,744 --> 01:58:49,954
Get outta here!

1790
01:58:50,037 --> 01:58:51,372
I'm stayin' right here.

1791
01:58:51,455 --> 01:58:53,124
I'll blow your fuckin' head off!

1792
01:58:53,207 --> 01:58:54,750
Then do it!

1793
01:58:54,834 --> 01:58:57,378
You want to do it?
Do it! Let's go.

1794
01:59:03,426 --> 01:59:05,511
Get outta here!

1795
01:59:06,887 --> 01:59:09,223
You fucked up, all right?
So what?

1796
01:59:09,306 --> 01:59:11,183
So everybody does it.

1797
01:59:11,809 --> 01:59:13,477
Get on with your life, would ya?

1798
01:59:13,561 --> 01:59:14,895
What life?

1799
01:59:15,980 --> 01:59:18,024
I got no life!

1800
01:59:20,151 --> 01:59:22,236
I'm in the dark here!

1801
01:59:23,946 --> 01:59:25,489
You understand?

1802
01:59:26,824 --> 01:59:28,409
I'm in the dark!

1803
01:59:34,081 --> 01:59:35,499
So give up.

1804
01:59:36,334 --> 01:59:39,837
You want to give up, give up.
Because I'm givin' up too.

1805
01:59:39,920 --> 01:59:42,256
You said I'm through.
You're right, I am through.

1806
01:59:42,340 --> 01:59:44,425
We're both through.
It's all over.

1807
01:59:45,051 --> 01:59:47,303
So let's get on with it.
Let's fuckin' do it.

1808
01:59:47,386 --> 01:59:51,974
Let's fuckin' pull the trigger,
you miserable blind motherfucker.

1809
02:00:00,858 --> 02:00:02,526
Pull the trigger.

1810
02:00:04,570 --> 02:00:06,363
Here we go, Charlie.

1811
02:00:07,740 --> 02:00:09,075
I'm ready.

1812
02:00:16,999 --> 02:00:18,876
You don't want to die.

1813
02:00:21,337 --> 02:00:23,130
And neither do you.

1814
02:00:26,592 --> 02:00:29,261
Give me one reason not to.

1815
02:00:33,724 --> 02:00:34,975
I'll give you two.

1816
02:00:35,393 --> 02:00:40,147
You can dance the tango and drive a Ferrari
better than anyone I've ever seen.

1817
02:00:45,319 --> 02:00:47,780
You never seen anyone do either.

1818
02:00:51,951 --> 02:00:54,078
Give me the gun, Colonel.

1819
02:01:05,005 --> 02:01:07,716
Oh, where do I go from here, Charlie?

1820
02:01:09,218 --> 02:01:11,929
If you're tangled up, just tango on.

1821
02:01:14,640 --> 02:01:16,934
You askin' me to dance, Charlie?

1822
02:01:24,233 --> 02:01:26,944
<i>Did you ever have the feelin'</i>

1823
02:01:27,027 --> 02:01:28,904
<i>That you wanted to go</i>

1824
02:01:30,614 --> 02:01:35,035
<i>And still had the feelin'
that you wanted to stay?</i>

1825
02:01:51,552 --> 02:01:53,637
You like my blues, Charlie?

1826
02:01:57,016 --> 02:01:59,059
Yeah, they're beautiful.

1827
02:02:00,394 --> 02:02:02,021
I wore these

1828
02:02:03,856 --> 02:02:05,733
for Lyndon's inauguration.

1829
02:02:08,235 --> 02:02:12,406
Of course,
we weren't the number one ball.

1830
02:02:15,951 --> 02:02:17,953
But he dropped by anyway.

1831
02:02:20,623 --> 02:02:22,917
Will you please give me the gun?

1832
02:02:26,921 --> 02:02:28,839
You're askin' an officer

1833
02:02:29,965 --> 02:02:32,551
to surrender his sidearm.

1834
02:02:33,928 --> 02:02:35,888
You don't have to surrender it.

1835
02:02:35,971 --> 02:02:38,349
Just put it down for a little while.

1836
02:02:39,225 --> 02:02:41,393
All right?
Just put it down.

1837
02:02:53,113 --> 02:02:55,616
Boy, I could use a drink, Charlie.

1838
02:02:59,119 --> 02:03:01,247
How about a cup of coffee?

1839
02:03:03,832 --> 02:03:07,044
Too big a leap for me
right now, Charlie.

1840
02:03:07,127 --> 02:03:08,545
Maybe tomorrow.

1841
02:03:11,465 --> 02:03:15,761
No, a Mr. John Daniels
would be preferred.

1842
02:03:18,472 --> 02:03:20,140
No water, Charlie.

1843
02:03:22,810 --> 02:03:24,103
No water.

1844
02:03:24,853 --> 02:03:26,146
Please.

1845
02:03:34,154 --> 02:03:36,156
Here's your drink, Colonel.

1846
02:03:42,830 --> 02:03:44,832
Oh, I'm so sorry.

1847
02:03:45,624 --> 02:03:48,210
What time do you want me
to turn down the bed?

1848
02:03:48,294 --> 02:03:50,254
Maybe later, all right?

1849
02:03:50,337 --> 02:03:52,298
What he means, señorita,

1850
02:03:53,465 --> 02:03:55,342
is come right in.

1851
02:03:58,887 --> 02:04:00,347
Later, please?

1852
02:04:01,432 --> 02:04:03,767
Yes, sir. Good afternoon.

1853
02:04:08,439 --> 02:04:09,940
Nice voice.

1854
02:04:14,236 --> 02:04:16,655
Boy, you have a one-track mind.

1855
02:04:18,615 --> 02:04:21,660
Is there anything else
in this world, Charlie?

1856
02:04:22,870 --> 02:04:24,371
Not for you.

1857
02:04:25,456 --> 02:04:28,542
You know what's kept me goin'
all these years?

1858
02:04:29,251 --> 02:04:30,919
The thought...

1859
02:04:32,212 --> 02:04:34,673
that one day...

1860
02:04:43,557 --> 02:04:44,892
Never mind.

1861
02:04:46,101 --> 02:04:47,394
The what?

1862
02:04:49,229 --> 02:04:50,606
Silly.

1863
02:04:53,484 --> 02:04:56,278
Just the thought
that maybe one day, I'd...

1864
02:05:00,282 --> 02:05:03,202
I could have a woman's arms
wrapped around me,

1865
02:05:05,037 --> 02:05:07,289
and her legs wrapped around me.

1866
02:05:10,084 --> 02:05:11,377
And what?

1867
02:05:16,215 --> 02:05:20,677
That I could wake up in the morning
and she'd still be there.

1868
02:05:22,096 --> 02:05:23,597
Smell of her.

1869
02:05:25,099 --> 02:05:26,809
All funky and warm.

1870
02:05:31,522 --> 02:05:33,440
I finally gave up on it.

1871
02:05:36,694 --> 02:05:39,238
I don't know why you can't have that.

1872
02:05:42,282 --> 02:05:44,743
When we get back to New Hampshire,

1873
02:05:44,827 --> 02:05:47,413
I don't know why you can't find someone.

1874
02:05:47,704 --> 02:05:50,749
You're a good-lookin' guy

1875
02:05:51,291 --> 02:05:53,335
and you're fun to be with

1876
02:05:54,128 --> 02:05:57,089
and you're a great travel companion,

1877
02:05:57,631 --> 02:06:00,259
sensitive, compassionate.

1878
02:06:04,304 --> 02:06:05,472
Charlie,

1879
02:06:06,849 --> 02:06:08,934
are you fuckin' with me?

1880
02:06:12,980 --> 02:06:14,148
Yes.

1881
02:06:18,569 --> 02:06:19,820
Yeah?

1882
02:06:20,612 --> 02:06:22,030
Hey, Manny.

1883
02:06:27,286 --> 02:06:28,537
We missed our plane.

1884
02:06:28,620 --> 02:06:30,664
Your plane, Charlie.

1885
02:06:30,747 --> 02:06:32,541
My ticket was one-way.

1886
02:06:34,543 --> 02:06:36,753
New England Thruway
all the way, Colonel?

1887
02:06:36,837 --> 02:06:38,672
All the way, Manolo.

1888
02:06:50,851 --> 02:06:53,854
I'm gettin' that heavy feelin'
again, Charlie.

1889
02:06:59,902 --> 02:07:03,071
I think you were right
about George and his father.

1890
02:07:03,489 --> 02:07:05,449
I'm sorry to hear that.

1891
02:07:05,532 --> 02:07:10,287
When we get back Mr. Trask is bringing us
up in front of the whole school.

1892
02:07:10,370 --> 02:07:12,623
Puttin' your feet to the fire?

1893
02:07:12,706 --> 02:07:15,542
Special meeting of
the disciplinary committee.

1894
02:07:17,169 --> 02:07:19,546
And what are you gonna tell 'em?

1895
02:07:22,382 --> 02:07:24,927
I don't know.
I'll think of somethin'.

1896
02:07:26,845 --> 02:07:30,474
Charlie, why are you all alone
in this thing?

1897
02:07:32,559 --> 02:07:34,311
Where's your father?

1898
02:07:35,896 --> 02:07:37,397
He left.

1899
02:07:38,815 --> 02:07:43,070
I thought it was a mom-and-pop store.
Who's the pop?

1900
02:07:43,570 --> 02:07:45,280
It's my stepfather.

1901
02:07:46,281 --> 02:07:48,158
Oh, yeah.

1902
02:07:50,244 --> 02:07:53,914
But why isn't he in on this?
Somethin' wrong with him?

1903
02:07:55,249 --> 02:07:57,793
No, he's okay. We just...

1904
02:07:58,252 --> 02:07:59,837
We don't get along very well.

1905
02:07:59,920 --> 02:08:01,213
Why not?

1906
02:08:02,923 --> 02:08:04,424
Because he's an asshole.

1907
02:08:09,137 --> 02:08:12,432
Well, that's all right, Charlie.

1908
02:08:14,601 --> 02:08:17,479
Every family's got one nowadays.

1909
02:08:47,384 --> 02:08:48,719
That's it?

1910
02:08:49,052 --> 02:08:50,095
That's it.

1911
02:08:50,178 --> 02:08:51,555
Take care of yourself, kid.

1912
02:08:51,638 --> 02:08:53,515
All right, Manny. Thanks.

1913
02:08:59,354 --> 02:09:01,356
No, I'm not opening.

1914
02:09:02,983 --> 02:09:04,526
I hate goodbyes.

1915
02:09:07,154 --> 02:09:08,697
So...

1916
02:09:09,489 --> 02:09:11,116
You'll be all right, huh?

1917
02:09:12,492 --> 02:09:13,994
I'll be fine.

1918
02:09:15,495 --> 02:09:16,788
All right.

1919
02:09:20,083 --> 02:09:21,668
What's that?

1920
02:09:22,586 --> 02:09:24,338
That's first bell.

1921
02:09:26,006 --> 02:09:28,425
Just got time to get cleaned up.

1922
02:09:31,803 --> 02:09:33,513
I almost forgot.

1923
02:09:37,809 --> 02:09:39,770
I owe you some money.

1924
02:09:42,105 --> 02:09:45,275
$300. Job well done.

1925
02:09:49,488 --> 02:09:52,282
You ever need any references,
Charlie, I'm your man.

1926
02:09:54,409 --> 02:09:56,036
Thanks, Colonel.

1927
02:10:02,834 --> 02:10:05,796
16 Water Street. Over the bridge.

1928
02:10:05,879 --> 02:10:07,381
We'll find it.

1929
02:10:08,423 --> 02:10:10,175
Goodbye, Charlie.

1930
02:10:11,885 --> 02:10:13,595
Goodbye, Colonel.

1931
02:10:16,723 --> 02:10:18,350
Come here, son.

1932
02:10:35,075 --> 02:10:36,451
Okay, Manny.

1933
02:11:50,650 --> 02:11:52,652
George. George!

1934
02:12:31,817 --> 02:12:34,569
I called an open meeting
of this institution this morning

1935
02:12:34,653 --> 02:12:37,864
because the incident
that occurred this Tuesday last

1936
02:12:37,948 --> 02:12:42,035
describes an issue
that concerns all of us.

1937
02:12:43,495 --> 02:12:45,622
Not an isolated case of vandalism.

1938
02:12:45,705 --> 02:12:50,460
What happened is a symptom
of the sickness of a society.

1939
02:12:51,920 --> 02:12:57,175
A sickness which runs counter to
the principles this school was founded on.

1940
02:12:59,386 --> 02:13:01,680
A school among whose graduates

1941
02:13:01,763 --> 02:13:06,560
two have sat behind the desk
in the Oval Office, in the White House.

1942
02:13:07,644 --> 02:13:10,981
Baird men have run State Departments
and investment houses,

1943
02:13:11,731 --> 02:13:14,818
founded department stores
and coached football teams.

1944
02:13:14,901 --> 02:13:18,363
Our alumni receive their bulletins
in ashrams in India

1945
02:13:18,822 --> 02:13:20,657
and in palaces in Jordan.

1946
02:13:20,740 --> 02:13:23,160
We are, in fact,
known around the world

1947
02:13:23,243 --> 02:13:26,329
as the cradle of
this country's leadership.

1948
02:13:26,413 --> 02:13:28,331
- A beacon in the...
- What are you doing here?

1949
02:13:28,415 --> 02:13:30,208
Got room for me up there, Charlie?

1950
02:13:30,292 --> 02:13:33,336
But today we are bleeding from disrespect.

1951
02:13:33,420 --> 02:13:34,588
Yeah, I guess so.

1952
02:13:34,671 --> 02:13:36,464
- Blatant disrespect.
- Give us a hand.

1953
02:13:36,548 --> 02:13:38,675
A disrespect for our values,

1954
02:13:38,758 --> 02:13:42,554
and a disrespect for our standards.

1955
02:13:42,637 --> 02:13:46,016
A disrespect
for the Baird tradition.

1956
02:13:46,099 --> 02:13:48,894
And, as the custodians
of that tradition,

1957
02:13:50,020 --> 02:13:54,232
we are here today
to protect each other

1958
02:13:54,774 --> 02:13:57,277
from those who threaten it.

1959
02:13:58,445 --> 02:14:00,405
Who is this, Mr. Simms?

1960
02:14:02,616 --> 02:14:04,534
This is Mr. Frank Slade,

1961
02:14:05,327 --> 02:14:08,580
Lieutenant Colonel,
United States Army, retired.

1962
02:14:09,873 --> 02:14:12,208
I'm here in place of
Charlie's parents.

1963
02:14:12,459 --> 02:14:13,793
Excuse me?

1964
02:14:14,085 --> 02:14:15,712
In loco parentis.

1965
02:14:18,048 --> 02:14:21,218
They could not make the trip
from Oregon today.

1966
02:14:21,301 --> 02:14:24,262
And what is your relationship
to Mr. Simms?

1967
02:14:24,346 --> 02:14:26,139
Is this a courtroom?

1968
02:14:27,057 --> 02:14:29,017
Closest thing we could manage to it.

1969
02:14:29,100 --> 02:14:32,771
Then if we're taking oaths,
there's a few people I'd like to swear in.

1970
02:14:35,106 --> 02:14:37,317
There are no oaths at Baird.

1971
02:14:38,360 --> 02:14:40,362
We are all on our honor.

1972
02:14:42,322 --> 02:14:47,327
Larry and Franny Simms are
very dear, close friends of mine.

1973
02:14:48,078 --> 02:14:51,289
They've asked me to appear here
on Charlie's behalf.

1974
02:14:52,207 --> 02:14:53,416
Okay?

1975
02:14:55,961 --> 02:14:58,380
Happy to have you with us, Colonel.

1976
02:15:02,634 --> 02:15:03,969
Mr. Willis.

1977
02:15:06,346 --> 02:15:08,014
Which Mr. Willis?

1978
02:15:08,098 --> 02:15:09,516
George, Junior, sir.

1979
02:15:14,562 --> 02:15:16,106
Yes.

1980
02:15:16,189 --> 02:15:20,986
You were in a position last Tuesday night
to see who committed this act of vandalism.

1981
02:15:21,069 --> 02:15:22,487
Who was it?

1982
02:15:24,489 --> 02:15:27,742
Well, I have an idea who it was.

1983
02:15:27,826 --> 02:15:29,369
No, not an idea, Mr. Willis.

1984
02:15:29,452 --> 02:15:31,288
Did you see or did you not see?

1985
02:15:34,291 --> 02:15:35,625
Well...

1986
02:15:37,377 --> 02:15:39,713
I didn't have my contacts in.

1987
02:15:43,800 --> 02:15:45,051
Come on.

1988
02:15:48,888 --> 02:15:51,975
I was in the library.
I'd taken my glasses off,

1989
02:15:52,058 --> 02:15:54,644
and I was gonna put
my contacts back in.

1990
02:16:00,066 --> 02:16:01,776
Then I helped Simms close up

1991
02:16:01,860 --> 02:16:04,779
and the next thing I know,
we're outside,

1992
02:16:04,863 --> 02:16:06,906
and I hear this sound and

1993
02:16:09,075 --> 02:16:11,911
I didn't have any time
to put my contacts in.

1994
02:16:12,537 --> 02:16:15,248
Whom, with your limited vision,
did you see?

1995
02:16:32,807 --> 02:16:34,934
Like I say, it was blurry.

1996
02:16:40,815 --> 02:16:43,359
I can't see without my contacts.

1997
02:16:43,443 --> 02:16:45,862
What did you see, Mr. Willis?

1998
02:16:46,196 --> 02:16:47,405
What?

1999
02:16:48,448 --> 02:16:49,783
You mean definitively?

2000
02:16:49,866 --> 02:16:51,618
Stop fencing with me, Mr. Willis!

2001
02:16:51,701 --> 02:16:53,620
Tell me what you saw!

2002
02:16:58,750 --> 02:17:02,962
Now, don't hold me to this,
but no contacts, it's dark...

2003
02:17:05,465 --> 02:17:06,925
And everything, I mean...

2004
02:17:07,008 --> 02:17:08,426
Mr. Willis!

2005
02:17:11,596 --> 02:17:12,680
Maybe...

2006
02:17:15,141 --> 02:17:17,060
Harry Havemeyer,

2007
02:17:17,852 --> 02:17:20,855
Trent Potter and Jimmy Jameson.

2008
02:17:25,026 --> 02:17:26,152
Maybe?

2009
02:17:26,236 --> 02:17:27,946
Ballpark, best guess.

2010
02:17:30,156 --> 02:17:32,909
Could you provide us
with some detail?

2011
02:17:35,495 --> 02:17:38,998
Why don't you ask Charlie?
I really think he was closer.

2012
02:17:47,966 --> 02:17:49,300
Mr. Simms.

2013
02:17:50,385 --> 02:17:52,262
Yes.

2014
02:17:52,345 --> 02:17:55,056
You don't wear contact lenses, do you?

2015
02:17:55,140 --> 02:17:56,433
No, sir.

2016
02:17:58,184 --> 02:18:02,188
With your untrammeled sight,
whom did you see?

2017
02:18:06,568 --> 02:18:08,361
Well, I saw something,

2018
02:18:10,363 --> 02:18:12,824
but I couldn't say who.

2019
02:18:13,533 --> 02:18:16,453
All right.
What was the something you saw?

2020
02:18:20,373 --> 02:18:21,374
I couldn't say.

2021
02:18:21,457 --> 02:18:23,209
You couldn't or wouldn't say?

2022
02:18:25,962 --> 02:18:27,505
Well, I just...

2023
02:18:31,467 --> 02:18:32,760
I just couldn't say.

2024
02:18:32,844 --> 02:18:34,429
Couldn't, wouldn't, shouldn't.

2025
02:18:34,512 --> 02:18:37,891
You're exhausting my patience
and making a mockery of these proceedings.

2026
02:18:37,974 --> 02:18:39,642
I will give you one last chance.

2027
02:18:39,726 --> 02:18:42,228
The consequences of your response
will be dire.

2028
02:18:42,312 --> 02:18:46,649
By dire, I mean your future will be
jeopardized permanently.

2029
02:18:48,276 --> 02:18:50,111
Now for the last time,

2030
02:18:50,195 --> 02:18:54,574
what did you see last Tuesday night
outside my office?

2031
02:18:58,745 --> 02:19:00,497
I saw somebody.

2032
02:19:00,580 --> 02:19:02,749
I saw somebody. Good.

2033
02:19:03,917 --> 02:19:06,294
Did you see their size and shape?

2034
02:19:07,754 --> 02:19:09,088
Yeah.

2035
02:19:09,839 --> 02:19:12,508
And they were the size
and shape of whom?

2036
02:19:17,972 --> 02:19:20,058
They were the size and shape

2037
02:19:35,114 --> 02:19:37,283
of most any Baird student, sir.

2038
02:19:52,423 --> 02:19:54,676
I am left with no real witness.

2039
02:19:56,469 --> 02:20:00,348
Mr. Willis' testimony is not only vague,
it is unsubstantiated.

2040
02:20:00,473 --> 02:20:05,103
The substance I was looking for, Mr. Simms,
was to come from you.

2041
02:20:08,815 --> 02:20:10,191
I'm sorry.

2042
02:20:11,776 --> 02:20:13,820
I'm sorry too, Mr. Simms,

2043
02:20:14,696 --> 02:20:16,572
because you know
what I'm going to do

2044
02:20:16,656 --> 02:20:21,536
in as much as I can't punish Mr. Havemeyer,
Mr. Potter or Mr. Jameson?

2045
02:20:21,619 --> 02:20:23,663
And I won't punish Mr. Willis.

2046
02:20:24,247 --> 02:20:26,165
He's the only party to this incident

2047
02:20:26,249 --> 02:20:29,210
who is still worthy of calling
himself a Baird man.

2048
02:20:30,503 --> 02:20:33,673
I'm going to recommend to
the disciplinary committee

2049
02:20:35,508 --> 02:20:37,427
that you be expelled.

2050
02:20:37,510 --> 02:20:41,639
Mr. Simms, you are a cover-up artist
and you are a liar.

2051
02:20:41,723 --> 02:20:43,683
But not a snitch!

2052
02:20:45,184 --> 02:20:46,644
Excuse me?

2053
02:20:46,728 --> 02:20:48,313
No, I don't think I will.

2054
02:20:48,396 --> 02:20:49,772
Mr. Slade.

2055
02:20:49,856 --> 02:20:52,317
This is such a crock of shit!

2056
02:20:53,693 --> 02:20:55,862
Please watch your language,
Mr. Slade.

2057
02:20:55,945 --> 02:20:58,865
You are in the Baird school,
not a barracks.

2058
02:20:59,282 --> 02:21:02,160
Mr. Simms, I will give you
one final opportunity to speak up.

2059
02:21:02,243 --> 02:21:04,370
Mr. Simms doesn't want it.

2060
02:21:05,079 --> 02:21:09,167
He doesn't need to be labeled
still worthy of being a Baird man.

2061
02:21:09,584 --> 02:21:11,502
What the hell is that?

2062
02:21:11,586 --> 02:21:13,629
What is your motto here?

2063
02:21:13,713 --> 02:21:17,800
Boys, inform on your classmates,
save your hide,

2064
02:21:17,884 --> 02:21:21,262
anything short of that,
we're gonna burn you at the stake?

2065
02:21:21,346 --> 02:21:23,514
Well, gentlemen,

2066
02:21:23,598 --> 02:21:26,976
when the shit hits the fan,
some guys run,

2067
02:21:27,060 --> 02:21:28,686
and some guys stay.

2068
02:21:28,770 --> 02:21:32,231
Here's Charlie, facin' the fire,
and there's George,

2069
02:21:32,315 --> 02:21:34,817
hidin' in big daddy's pocket.

2070
02:21:34,901 --> 02:21:36,527
And what are you doin'?

2071
02:21:36,611 --> 02:21:40,573
You're gonna reward George
and destroy Charlie.

2072
02:21:42,325 --> 02:21:43,826
Are you finished, Mr. Slade?

2073
02:21:43,910 --> 02:21:46,037
No, I'm just gettin' warmed up.

2074
02:21:47,080 --> 02:21:49,123
I don't know who went to this place.

2075
02:21:49,207 --> 02:21:52,210
William Howard Taft,
William Jennings Bryan,

2076
02:21:52,293 --> 02:21:53,878
William Tell, whoever.

2077
02:21:53,961 --> 02:21:57,256
Their spirit is dead,
if they ever had one.

2078
02:21:57,340 --> 02:21:58,674
It's gone.

2079
02:21:58,758 --> 02:22:01,636
You're buildin' a rat ship here,

2080
02:22:01,719 --> 02:22:04,639
a vessel for seagoin' snitches.

2081
02:22:04,722 --> 02:22:08,476
And if you think you're preparin'
these minnows for manhood,

2082
02:22:08,559 --> 02:22:10,103
you better think again,

2083
02:22:10,186 --> 02:22:15,942
because I say you are killin' the very spirit
this institution proclaims it instills.

2084
02:22:17,193 --> 02:22:18,778
What a sham.

2085
02:22:18,903 --> 02:22:21,823
What kind of a show are you guys
puttin' on here today?

2086
02:22:21,906 --> 02:22:25,368
The only class in this act
is sittin' next to me.

2087
02:22:25,451 --> 02:22:29,163
And I'm here to tell you
this boy's soul is intact.

2088
02:22:29,247 --> 02:22:31,999
It's non-negotiable.
You know how I know?

2089
02:22:32,083 --> 02:22:35,753
Someone here, and I won't say who,
offered to buy it.

2090
02:22:36,170 --> 02:22:38,214
Only Charlie here wasn't sellin'.

2091
02:22:38,297 --> 02:22:39,715
Sir, you're out of order.

2092
02:22:39,799 --> 02:22:42,051
I'd show you out of order.

2093
02:22:42,135 --> 02:22:45,138
You don't know what
out of order is, Mr. Trask.

2094
02:22:45,221 --> 02:22:47,390
I'd show you, but I'm too old,

2095
02:22:47,473 --> 02:22:49,976
I'm too tired,
I'm too fuckin' blind.

2096
02:22:50,059 --> 02:22:55,481
If I were the man I was five years ago,
I'd take a flamethrower to this place!

2097
02:22:58,609 --> 02:23:01,738
Out of order?
Who the hell you think you're talkin' to?

2098
02:23:03,322 --> 02:23:05,491
I've been around, you know?

2099
02:23:06,159 --> 02:23:08,327
There was a time I could see.

2100
02:23:08,828 --> 02:23:10,413
And I have seen.

2101
02:23:10,997 --> 02:23:13,291
Boys like these,
younger than these,

2102
02:23:13,374 --> 02:23:16,711
their arms torn out,
their legs ripped off.

2103
02:23:17,295 --> 02:23:22,258
But there is nothin' like the sight
of an amputated spirit.

2104
02:23:22,341 --> 02:23:25,219
There is no prosthetic for that.

2105
02:23:26,971 --> 02:23:30,433
You think you're merely sendin'
this splendid foot soldier

2106
02:23:30,516 --> 02:23:33,728
back home to Oregon
with his tail between his legs,

2107
02:23:33,811 --> 02:23:37,732
but I say
you are executin' his soul!

2108
02:23:39,025 --> 02:23:40,359
And why?

2109
02:23:41,277 --> 02:23:43,654
Because he's not a Baird man.

2110
02:23:44,322 --> 02:23:47,158
Baird men.
You hurt this boy,

2111
02:23:47,241 --> 02:23:50,036
you're gonna be Baird bums,
the lot of you.

2112
02:23:50,203 --> 02:23:52,455
And, Harry, Jimmy,

2113
02:23:53,289 --> 02:23:55,958
Trent,
wherever you are out there,

2114
02:23:56,042 --> 02:23:57,627
fuck you too!

2115
02:24:00,213 --> 02:24:02,131
Stand down, Mr. Slade!

2116
02:24:02,215 --> 02:24:03,716
I'm not finished.

2117
02:24:04,884 --> 02:24:09,138
As I came in here,
I heard those words,

2118
02:24:09,222 --> 02:24:11,182
cradle of leadership.

2119
02:24:12,391 --> 02:24:17,813
Well, when the bough breaks,
the cradle will fall, and it has fallen here.

2120
02:24:17,897 --> 02:24:19,482
It has fallen.

2121
02:24:19,565 --> 02:24:22,568
Makers of men,
creators of leaders.

2122
02:24:22,693 --> 02:24:26,072
Be careful what kind of leaders
you're producin' here.

2123
02:24:27,031 --> 02:24:31,160
I don't know if Charlie's silence
here today is right or wrong.

2124
02:24:31,244 --> 02:24:32,745
I'm not a judge or jury.

2125
02:24:32,828 --> 02:24:34,622
But I can tell you this,

2126
02:24:34,705 --> 02:24:38,459
he won't sell anybody out
to buy his future!

2127
02:24:39,752 --> 02:24:42,922
And that, my friends,
is called integrity.

2128
02:24:43,881 --> 02:24:45,758
That's called courage.

2129
02:24:45,883 --> 02:24:49,053
Now that's the stuff
leaders should be made of.

2130
02:24:54,600 --> 02:24:58,104
Now I have come to
the crossroads in my life.

2131
02:24:59,272 --> 02:25:02,608
I always knew
what the right path was.

2132
02:25:03,609 --> 02:25:06,946
Without exception, I knew,
but I never took it.

2133
02:25:07,446 --> 02:25:08,948
You know why?

2134
02:25:09,574 --> 02:25:12,535
It was too damn hard.

2135
02:25:14,161 --> 02:25:17,248
Now here's Charlie.
He's come to the crossroads.

2136
02:25:17,331 --> 02:25:20,793
He has chosen a path.
It's the right path.

2137
02:25:21,794 --> 02:25:25,464
It's a path made of principle
that leads to character.

2138
02:25:28,467 --> 02:25:30,887
Let him continue on his journey.

2139
02:25:32,972 --> 02:25:36,475
You hold this boy's future
in your hands, committee.

2140
02:25:37,685 --> 02:25:41,230
It's a valuable future,
believe me.

2141
02:25:42,481 --> 02:25:45,151
Don't destroy it. Protect it.

2142
02:25:46,819 --> 02:25:48,237
Embrace it.

2143
02:25:48,988 --> 02:25:52,158
It's gonna make you proud one day,
I promise you.

2144
02:26:09,717 --> 02:26:11,677
How's that for cornball?

2145
02:26:33,199 --> 02:26:35,284
Nothing can shut them up, sir.

2146
02:26:39,789 --> 02:26:42,958
The disciplinary committee will take
this matter under advisement

2147
02:26:43,042 --> 02:26:45,211
in closed session.

2148
02:26:53,219 --> 02:26:55,429
What are they doin', Charlie?

2149
02:26:56,222 --> 02:26:59,392
I think they're going to come
to a decision now.

2150
02:27:02,728 --> 02:27:04,063
Very well.

2151
02:27:09,568 --> 02:27:12,405
Apparently, that meeting
will be unnecessary.

2152
02:27:13,239 --> 02:27:14,740
Mrs. Hunsaker.

2153
02:27:18,911 --> 02:27:24,166
The joint student-faculty disciplinary
committee needs no further sessions.

2154
02:27:24,250 --> 02:27:26,836
They have come to a decision.

2155
02:27:26,919 --> 02:27:31,465
Messrs. Havemeyer, Potter and Jameson
are placed on probation

2156
02:27:32,007 --> 02:27:34,969
for suspicion of ungentlemanly conduct.

2157
02:27:35,261 --> 02:27:38,514
It is further recommended
that Mr. George Willis, Jr.

2158
02:27:38,597 --> 02:27:41,809
receive neither recognition
nor commendation

2159
02:27:41,892 --> 02:27:43,686
for his cooperation.

2160
02:27:45,104 --> 02:27:49,775
Mr. Charles Simms is excused from
any further response to this incident.

2161
02:28:50,920 --> 02:28:52,129
Last step.

2162
02:28:52,213 --> 02:28:54,507
I can always count on you, Charlie.

2163
02:28:57,676 --> 02:28:59,178
Colonel!

2164
02:29:02,723 --> 02:29:04,558
I'm Christine Downes,
Colonel Slade.

2165
02:29:04,642 --> 02:29:06,268
I teach political science.

2166
02:29:06,352 --> 02:29:09,772
I wanted to tell you how much I appreciate
you speaking your mind.

2167
02:29:09,855 --> 02:29:11,690
Why, thank you.
Are you married?

2168
02:29:13,025 --> 02:29:14,151
I...

2169
02:29:16,695 --> 02:29:20,241
Went to an artillery school
at Fort Sill with a Mickey Downes.

2170
02:29:20,324 --> 02:29:21,992
Thought he might've snagged you.

2171
02:29:22,076 --> 02:29:24,245
No, I'm afraid not.

2172
02:29:25,913 --> 02:29:29,750
Colonel Slade was on
Lyndon Johnson's staff, Miss Downes.

2173
02:29:29,834 --> 02:29:32,128
Were you? Fascinating.

2174
02:29:32,211 --> 02:29:34,880
We should get together,
talk politics sometime.

2175
02:29:38,801 --> 02:29:40,636
Fleurs de Rocaille.

2176
02:29:42,346 --> 02:29:43,472
Yes.

2177
02:29:45,057 --> 02:29:47,184
Flowers from a brook.

2178
02:29:48,727 --> 02:29:50,187
That's right.

2179
02:29:53,983 --> 02:29:57,820
Well, Miss Downes,
I'll know where to find you.

2180
02:29:59,989 --> 02:30:01,407
Charlie.

2181
02:30:01,490 --> 02:30:02,825
Bye, Miss Downes.

2182
02:30:02,908 --> 02:30:04,160
Bye.

2183
02:30:07,413 --> 02:30:09,957
You don't have to tell me, Charlie.

2184
02:30:10,541 --> 02:30:11,667
5'7",

2185
02:30:13,252 --> 02:30:15,045
auburn hair,

2186
02:30:16,005 --> 02:30:18,507
beautiful brown eyes.

2187
02:30:37,276 --> 02:30:38,903
Yabba-dabba-doo.

2188
02:30:43,574 --> 02:30:44,742
Manny.

2189
02:30:47,453 --> 02:30:48,913
Oh, Colonel, this is too much.

2190
02:30:48,996 --> 02:30:50,456
Never mind, you earned it.

2191
02:30:50,539 --> 02:30:52,041
Next time Charlie and I

2192
02:30:52,124 --> 02:30:55,127
want to take a breather to New York,
we're gonna call you.

2193
02:30:55,211 --> 02:30:56,879
You can drive us both ways.

2194
02:30:56,962 --> 02:30:58,339
You're on, Colonel.

2195
02:30:58,422 --> 02:31:01,425
Not only will it be an honor,
I'll give you a rate.

2196
02:31:01,508 --> 02:31:04,136
I'll see your rate and raise you.

2197
02:31:04,220 --> 02:31:05,971
Stay outta harm's way, Manny.

2198
02:31:06,055 --> 02:31:07,181
Take care, Colonel.

2199
02:31:07,264 --> 02:31:08,557
You too.

2200
02:31:09,308 --> 02:31:11,810
- Ready?
- No. I'll take it from here.

2201
02:31:12,895 --> 02:31:14,230
You go on ahead.

2202
02:31:14,313 --> 02:31:16,607
Manny'll drive you to your dorm.

2203
02:31:18,025 --> 02:31:20,653
Come by before you go home
for Christmas.

2204
02:31:20,736 --> 02:31:22,905
We'll have a little cheer.

2205
02:31:22,988 --> 02:31:25,491
And if you like, stay for dinner.

2206
02:31:25,574 --> 02:31:28,535
Sometimes she cooks a pot roast.

2207
02:31:28,619 --> 02:31:30,287
It's almost edible.

2208
02:31:31,747 --> 02:31:34,291
All right, Colonel.
That'd be really...

2209
02:31:34,375 --> 02:31:35,834
Bye, Charlie.

2210
02:31:55,771 --> 02:31:59,441
Who's there?
That you, Francine?

2211
02:31:59,525 --> 02:32:00,484
Yes.

2212
02:32:00,567 --> 02:32:01,777
What are you doing?

2213
02:32:01,860 --> 02:32:03,821
Taking a ride.

2214
02:32:03,904 --> 02:32:05,572
Taking a ride?

2215
02:32:05,656 --> 02:32:07,992
What about you giving me a lift?

2216
02:32:08,075 --> 02:32:09,201
No.

2217
02:32:09,284 --> 02:32:10,411
No?

2218
02:32:10,911 --> 02:32:12,705
Come on, Francine.

2219
02:32:13,205 --> 02:32:16,208
We should make up.
Don't you think it's time we made up?

2220
02:32:16,709 --> 02:32:18,002
No.

2221
02:32:18,085 --> 02:32:19,753
- Francine?
- What?

2222
02:32:19,837 --> 02:32:25,134
Uncle Frank's had a really hard
Thanksgiving weekend.

2223
02:32:26,802 --> 02:32:29,388
What's that?
I hear a chipmunk.

2224
02:32:30,014 --> 02:32:31,890
Is it a walrus?

2225
02:32:32,182 --> 02:32:33,767
No, it's Willie.

2226
02:32:34,184 --> 02:32:36,812
Willie, why don't you help me
with my bag?

2227
02:32:36,895 --> 02:32:39,398
Come on, son.
Help me with my bag.

2228
02:32:39,690 --> 02:32:41,900
Come on. Come on.

2229
02:32:42,359 --> 02:32:45,946
You got it. Hold onto it.
You're strong. Come on.

2230
02:32:48,282 --> 02:32:49,742
Here we are.

2231
02:32:50,951 --> 02:32:53,537
Francine,
come on with me and Willie.

2232
02:32:53,746 --> 02:32:56,457
I'll let you make me
some marshmallow chocolate.

2233
02:32:56,540 --> 02:32:58,250
What do you say?

2234
02:32:58,542 --> 02:32:59,543
Good!
